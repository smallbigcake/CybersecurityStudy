# Exam Guide

## Chapter 1

- Understand the CIA Triad elements of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality is the principle that objects are not disclosed to unauthorized subjects. Integrity is the principle that objects retain their veracity and are intentionally modified only by authorized subjects. Availability is the principle that authorized subjects are granted timely and uninterrupted access to objects.
- Know the elements of AAA services. AAA is composed of identification, authentication, authorization, auditing, and accountability.
- Be able to explain how identification works. Identification is the process by which a subject professes an identity and accountability is initiated. A subject must provide an identity to a system to start the process of authentication, authorization, and accountability.
- Understand the process of authentication. Authentication is the process of verifying or testing that a claimed identity is valid. Authentication requires information from the subject that must exactly correspond to the identity indicated.
- Know how authorization fits into a security plan. Once a subject is authenticated, its access must be authorized. The process of authorization ensures that the requested activity or object access is possible given the rights and privileges assigned to the authenticated identity.
- Be able to explain the auditing process. Auditing is the programmatic means by which subjects are held accountable for their actions while authenticated on a system through the documentation or recording of subject activities.
- Understand the importance of accountability. Security can be maintained only if subjects are held accountable for their actions. Effective accountability relies on the capability to prove a subject’s identity and track their activities.
- Be able to explain nonrepudiation. Nonrepudiation ensures that the subject of an activity or event cannot deny that the event occurred. It prevents a subject from claiming not to have sent a message, not to have performed an action, or not to have been the cause of an event.
- Know about defense in depth. Defense in depth, also known as layering, is simply the use of multiple controls in a series. Using a multilayered solution allows for numerous different controls to guard against whatever threats come to pass.
- Be able to explain the concept of abstraction. Abstraction is used to collect similar elements into groups, classes, or roles that are assigned security controls, restrictions, or permissions as a collective. It adds efficiency to carrying out a security plan.
- Understand data hiding. Data hiding is exactly what it sounds like: preventing data from being discovered or accessed by a subject. It is often a key element in security controls as well as in programming.
- Know about security boundaries. A security boundary is the line of intersection between any two areas, subnets, or environments that have different security requirements or needs.
- Understand security governance. Security governance is the collection of practices related to supporting, defining, and directing the security efforts of an organization.
- Know about third-party governance. Third-party governance is the system of external entity oversight that may be mandated by law, regulation, industry standards, contractual obligation, or licensing requirements. The actual method of governance may vary, but it generally involves an outside investigator or auditor.
- Understand documentation review. Documentation review is the process of reading the exchanged materials and verifying them against standards and expectations. In many situations, especially related to government or military agencies or contractors, failing to provide sufficient documentation to meet requirements of third-party governance can result in a loss of or a voiding of authorization to operate (ATO).
- Understand alignment of security function to business strategy, goals, mission, and objectives. Security management planning ensures proper creation, implementation, and enforcement of a security policy. Security management planning aligns the security functions to the strategy, goals, mission, and objectives of the organization. This includes designing and implementing security based on business cases, budget restrictions, or scarcity of resources.
- Know what a business case is. A business case is usually a documented argument or stated position in order to define a need to make a decision or take some form of action. To make a business case is to demonstrate a business-specific need to alter an existing process or choose an approach to a business task. A business case is often made to justify the start of a new project, especially a project related to security.
- Understand security management planning. Security management is based on three types of plans: strategic, tactical, and operational. A strategic plan is a long-term plan that is fairly stable. It defines the organization’s goals, mission, and objectives. The tactical plan is a midterm plan developed to provide more details on accomplishing the goals set forth in the strategic plan. Operational plans are short-term and highly detailed plans based on the strategic and tactical plans.
- Know the elements of a formalized security policy structure. To create a comprehensive security plan, you need the following items in place: security policy, standards, baselines, guidelines, and procedures.
- Understand organizational process. Security governance needs to address every aspect of an organization. This includes the organizational processes of acquisitions, divestitures, and governance committees.
- Understand key security roles. The primary security roles are senior manager, security professional, asset owner, custodian, user, and auditor.
- Know the basics of COBIT. Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) is a security concept infrastructure used to organize the complex security solutions of companies.
- Understand due diligence and due care. Due diligence is establishing a plan, policy, and process to protect the interests of an organization. Due care is practicing the individual activities that maintain the due diligence effort. Due diligence is knowing what should be done and planning for it; due care is doing the right action at the right time.
- Know the basics of threat modeling. Threat modeling is the security process where potential threats are identified, categorized, and analyzed. Threat modeling can be performed as a proactive measure during design and development or as a reactive measure once a product has been deployed. Key concepts include assets/attackers/software, STRIDE, PASTA, VAST, diagramming, reduction/decomposing, and DREAD.
- Understand supply chain risk management (SCRM) concepts. SCRM is a means to ensure that all the vendors or links in the supply chain are reliable, trustworthy, reputable organizations that disclose their practices and security requirements to their business partners. SCRM includes evaluating risks associated with hardware, software, and services; performing thirdparty assessment and monitoring; establishing minimum security requirements; and enforcing service-level requirements.
