The overall goal of BCP is to provide a quick, calm, and efficient response in the event
of an emergency and to enhance a company’s ability to recover from a disruptive event
promptly. The BCP process has four main steps:
■■ Project scope and planning
■■ Business impact analysis
■■ Continuity planning
■■ Approval and implementation


As with any formalized business process, the development of a resilient business continuity
plan requires the use of a proven methodology. Organizations should approach the planning
process with several goals in mind:
■■ Perform a structured review of the business’s organization from a crisis planning
point of view.
■■ Create a BCP team with the approval of senior management.
■■ Assess the resources available to participate in business continuity activities.
■■ Analyze the legal and regulatory landscape that governs an organization’s response to a
catastrophic event.


One of the first responsibilities of the individuals responsible for business continuity
planning is to perform an analysis of the business organization to identify all departments
and individuals who have a stake in the BCP process. Here are some areas to consider:
■■ Operational departments that are responsible for the core services the business provides
to its clients
■■ Critical support services, such as the IT department, facilities and maintenance personnel,
and other groups responsible for the upkeep of systems that support the operational
departments
■■ Corporate security teams responsible for physical security, since they are many times the
first responders to an incident and are also responsible for the physical safeguarding of
the primary facility and alternate processing facility
■■ Senior executives and other key individuals essential for the ongoing viability of the
organization


To prevent these situations from adversely impacting the BCP process, the individuals
responsible for the effort should take special care when selecting the BCP team. The team
should include, at a minimum, the following individuals:
■■ Representatives from each of the organization’s departments responsible for the core
services performed by the business
■■ Business unit team members from the functional areas identified by the organizational
analysis
■■ IT subject-matter experts with technical expertise in areas covered by the BCP
■■ Cybersecurity team members with knowledge of the BCP process
■■ Physical security and facility management teams responsible for the physical plant
■■ Attorneys familiar with corporate legal, regulatory, and contractual responsibilities
■■ Human resources team members who can address staffing issues and the impact on
individual employees
■■ Public relations team members who need to conduct similar planning for how they will
communicate with stakeholders and the public in the event of a disruption
■■ Senior management representatives with the ability to set the vision, define priorities,
and allocate resources


After the team validates the organizational review, it should turn to an assessment of the
resources required by the BCP effort. This assessment involves the resources needed by three
distinct BCP phases:
BCP Development The BCP team will require some resources to perform the four elements
of the BCP process (project scope and planning, business impact analysis, continuity
planning, and approval and implementation). It’s more than likely that the major
resource consumed by this BCP phase will be effort expended by members of the BCP
team and the support staff they call on to assist in the development of the plan.
BCP Testing, Training, and Maintenance The testing, training, and maintenance phases
of BCP will require some hardware and software commitments. Still, once again, the
major commitment in this phase will be the effort of the employees involved in those
activities.
BCP Implementation When a disaster strikes and the BCP team deems it necessary to
conduct a full-scale implementation of the business continuity plan, the implementation
will require significant resources. Those resources include a large amount of effort
(BCP will likely become the focus of a large part, if not all, of the organization) as well
as direct financial expenses. For this reason, the team must use its BCP implementation
powers judiciously yet decisively.
