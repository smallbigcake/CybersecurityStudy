# Security and Risk Management

## UNDERSTAND, ADHERE TO, AND PROMOTE PROFESSIONAL ETHICS

### (ISC)2 Code of Professional Ethics

#### Code of Ethics Preamble

* The safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principals, and to each other requires that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior.
* Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification.

#### Code of Ethics Canons

* I. Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure. Security professionals have great social responsibility. We are charged with the burden of ensuring that our actions benefit the common good.
* II. Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally. Integrity is essential to the conduct of our duties. We cannot carry out our duties effectively if others within our organization, the security community, or the general public have doubts about the accuracy of the guidance we provide or the motives behind our actions.
* III. Provide diligent and competent service to principals. Although we have responsibilities to society as a whole, we also have specific responsibilities to those who have hired us to protect their infrastructure. We must ensure that we are in a position to provide unbiased, competent service to our organization.
* IV. Advance and protect the profession. Our chosen profession changes on a continuous basis. As security professionals, we must ensure that our knowledge remains current and that we contribute our own knowledge to the community's common body of knowledge.

#### Code of Ethics Complaints

* Any member of the general public may file a complaint involving canons I or II.
* Only an employer or someone with a contracting relationship with the individual may file a complaint under canon III.
* Other professionals may file a complaint under canon IV. It is important to note that this is not limited to cybersecurity professionals. Anyone who is certified or licensed as a professional and subscribes to a code of ethics as part of that licensure or certification is eligible to file a canon IV complaint.

### Organizational Code of Ethics

#### Code of Ethics for Government Service
The U.S. government has a Code of Ethics for Government Service that is written into federal law.
Passed by Congress in 1980, this code says that any person in government service should:
* Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department.
* Uphold the Constitution, laws, and regulations of the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion.
* Give a full day’s labor for a full day’s pay; giving earnest effort and best thought to the performance of duties.
* Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.
* Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never accept, for himself or herself or for family members, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of governmental duties.
* Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.
* Engage in no business with the Government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of governmental duties.
* Never use any information gained confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means of making private profit.
* Expose corruption wherever discovered.
* Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.

#### RFC 1087 - Ethics and the Internet

Issued by the Internet Activities Board (IAB) in 1989

RFC 1087 states that any activity with the following purposes is unacceptable and unethical:
* Seeks to gain unauthorized access to the resources of the internet
* Disrupts the intended use of the internet
* Wastes resources (people, capacity, computer) through such actions
* Destroys the integrity of computer-based information
* Compromises the privacy of users

#### Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics

Issued by the Computer Ethics Institute (CEI) in 1992

1. Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.
2. Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work.
3. Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.
4. Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.
5. Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness.
6. Thou shalt not copy proprietary software for which you have not paid.
7. Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.
8. Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output.
9. Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing.
10. Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.

#### Code of Fair Information Practices

Issued by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in 1973

1. There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret.
2. There must be a way for a person to find out what information about the person is in a record and how it is used.
3. There must be a way for a person to prevent information about the person that was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other purposes without the person's consent.
4. There must be a way for a person to correct or amend a record of identifiable information about the person.
5. Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuses of the data.

## UNDERSTAND AND APPLY SECURITY CONCEPTS

### Confidentiality

### Integrity

### Availability

* Accessibility
* Usability
* Timeliness

### Limitations of the CIA Triad

The Parkerian Hexad contains the following concepts:
* **Confidentiality:** The limits on who has access to information
* **Integrity:** Whether the information is in its intended state
* **Availability:** Whether the information can be accessed in a timely manner
* **Authenticity:** The proper attribution of the person who created the information
* **Utility:** The usefulness of the information
* **Possession or control:** The physical state where the information is maintained

## EVALUATE AND APPLY SECURITY GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES

Applying security governance principles involves the following:
* Aligning the organization’s security function to the company’s business strategy, goals, mission, and objectives
* Defining and managing organizational processes that require security involvement or oversight (e.g., acquisitions, divestitures, and governance committees)
* Developing security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization
* Identifying one or more security control frameworks to align your organization with
* Conducting due diligence and due care activities on an ongoing basis

### Alignment of the Security Function to Business Strategy, Goals, Mission, and Objectives

#### Mission

A mission statement is a simple declaration that defines a company’s function and purpose; a mission statement summarizes what the company is, what it does, and why the company exists to do those things. A mission statement should be used to drive all corporate activities, including the organization’s allocation of time, finances, and effort.

#### Business Strategy

A business strategy describes the actions that a company takes to achieve its goals and objectives. Whereas a mission statement describes what will be achieved, an organization’s business strategy identifies exactly how the mission will be accomplished. A company’s mission statement rarely changes, but an organization’s strategy must be flexible enough to change as the business environment changes.

#### Goal

A goal, in business, is something that an organization expects to achieve or accomplish. Business goals help a company plan for success, and an organization’s goals should contribute to its mission.

Many companies use the SMART criteria to define their organizational goals. SMART is a mnemonic acronym that defines criteria for creating quality goals. A SMART goal must exhibit the following characteristics:
* Specific: State what you will do using real numbers and real deadlines.
* Measurable: Identify a way to evaluate progress and measure success (or failure). Use metrics or data targets to ensure that the goal is trackable.
* Achievable or Attainable: Establish challenging, but possible, goals that are within your scope.
* Relevant: Establish a goal that is pertinent to your overall mission and vision and aligned with your organization’s values and strategy.
* Time-bound: State when you will get the goal done, using specific dates or timeframes.

#### Objective

An objective is a milestone or a specific step that contributes to an organization reaching its goals and achieving its mission. Objectives are used to define incremental steps toward achieving a broader goal. Much like SMART goals, organizations often use the SMART framework to define quality objectives.

While many people incorrectly use the terms goal and objective interchangeably, you should understand that an objective is a short-term milestone that supports a longer-term goal.

#### Security Plan

##### Strategic Plan

A strategic plan is a long-term plan that is fairly stable. It defines the organization’s security purpose. It defines the security function and aligns it to the goals, mission, and objectives of the organization. It’s useful for about five years, if it is maintained and updated annually. The strategic plan also serves as the planning horizon. Long-term goals and visions for the future are discussed in a strategic plan. A strategic plan should include a risk assessment.

##### Tactical Plan

The tactical plan is a midterm plan developed to provide more details on accomplishing the goals set forth in the strategic plan, or can be crafted ad hoc based on unpredicted events. A tactical plan is typically useful for about a year and often prescribes and schedules the tasks necessary to accomplish organizational goals. Some examples of tactical plans are project plans, acquisition plans, hiring plans, budget plans, maintenance plans, support plans, and system development plans.

##### Operational Plan

An operational plan is a short-term, highly detailed plan based on the strategic and tactical plans. It is valid or useful only for a short time. Operational plans must be updated often (such as monthly or quarterly) to retain compliance with tactical plans. Operational plans spell out how to accomplish the various goals of the organization. They include resource allotments, budgetary requirements, staffing assignments, scheduling, and step-by-step or implementation procedures. Operational plans include details on how the implementation processes are in compliance with the organization’s security policy. Examples of operational plans are training plans, system deployment plans, and product design plans.


### Organizational Processes


**Security governance** is the set of all organizational processes involved in defining and managing information security policies and procedures, including the oversight to ensure that those policies and procedures follow the direction of the organization’s strategy and mission.

#### Governance Committees

A governance committee is a group of executives and leaders who regularly meet to set the direction of the company’s security function and provide guidance to help the security function align with the company’s overall mission and business strategy.

#### Mergers and Acquisitions

A merger is the combining of two separate organizations that creates a new, joint organization. An acquisition is the takeover of one organization by another. While mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have different business approaches, they share many of the same security concerns and are often discussed together.


Some M&A risk factors to consider include the following:
* **Absorbing the unknown:** When merging with or acquiring another organization, you are absorbing its entire IT infrastructure - good or bad. This means that you are acquiring systems that are likely managed differently from your own, and there may be significant differences in the security controls and processes in place. In addition, the acquired company may use homegrown or highly customized applications that will need to be securely integrated into your existing environment. Further, the acquired or absorbed company may use a different approach to threat modeling and vulnerability management (if they do these at all). Differences in security processes may result in operational challenges and inconsistent procedures during and after integration of the two businesses.
* **Creating new attack vectors:** By adding in new systems and platforms, you are potentially creating new routes for your company to be attacked. For example, if your organization uses Windows and macOS and you acquire a company that has a fleet of Linux systems, you now have a third operating system to manage and secure.
* **Impacting resources:** Mergers and acquisitions are challenging for everyone involved. Your IT teams may be stretched thin as they try to come up to speed on the newly acquired infrastructure while also keeping the existing systems running securely.
* **Disgruntled employees:** In addition to the burnout that employees may feel, corporate M&A can cause severe dissatisfaction in employees who were completely happy in their previously standalone company. Insider threat is commonly considered a top security concern, and acquiring disgruntled employees poses a severe threat to an organization.

Considering the risks from the previous list, an acquiring company (or both companies in a merger) should perform the following activities prior to completing an M&A deal:
* Review the company’s information security policies and procedures to determine how thorough they are. Take note of any missing security policies/procedures that may indicate a low level of security maturity.
* Review the company’s data assets and determine any applicable regulatory or compliance requirements (e.g., PCI, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.). Take particular note of any regulations that may present new requirements for your organization.
* Review the organization’s personnel security policies to identify potential issues or concerns. For example, your company may have compliance requirements to conduct a specific type of background check, and the target company may not be compliant.
* Identify any proprietary or custom applications managed by the company and request static and dynamic application security tests be run against them to
* Request results from a recent penetration test (pentest) that includes network, operating system, application, and database testing. Any critical or high findings should have a plan for remediation or mitigation.
* Review the organization’s use of third-party and open-source software to ensure that the software is safe and appropriately licensed.

#### Divestitures

A divestiture is the act of selling off or disposing of a subset of business interests or assets. An organization may pursue a divestiture for a number of reasons: political, social, or strictly financial. Divestitures often occur when management decides that a certain part of the business no longer aligns with the company’s business strategy or mission. Divestitures also frequently happen after a merger or acquisition, in cases where the merger or acquisition creates redundancies within the combined organization.

As a CISSP, you should ensure that your organization takes the following actions prior to completing a divestiture:
* Identify and categorize all assets that are involved in the divestiture; this includes hardware, software, and information assets. Creating a complete inventory of all impacted assets is a critical first step to ensuring a secure divestiture.
* Decouple impacted systems from your remaining infrastructure. Your company likely uses common human resources (HR), accounting, and technology systems (such as a virtual private network, email, etc.) to support the entire company. The assets being divested must be removed from this common infrastructure and spun out for the new organization to own and manage.
* Review all access permissions. You must identify who has access to the impacted assets and determine whether they need to maintain that access. People are sometimes part of a divestiture, and a subset of the employee base may leave with other divested assets. If that is the case in your divestiture, you must appropriately revoke unnecessary permissions while leaving required permissions intact.
* Consult your legal and compliance teams to ensure that you follow all required regulatory and compliance requirements around data retention, deletion, etc.

### Organizational Roles and Responsibilities

* Chief information security officer (CISO): A CISO is the senior-level executive within an organization who is responsible for the overall management and supervision of the information security program. The CISO drives the organization’s security strategy and vision and is ultimately responsible for the security of the company’s systems and information. While corporate reporting structures vary by company size and industry, most CISOs now report to a company’s chief information officer (CIO) or CEO.
* Chief security officer (CSO): A CSO is a senior-level executive within an organization who is generally responsible for all physical security and personnel security matters. Many organizations have merged CSO responsibilities into the CISO role, but you should be aware of the potential distinction between the two. To make matters even more confusing, some organizations refer to their overall security leader as a CSO (instead of CISO). You should lean on context anytime you see these titles used.
* Security analyst: A security analyst is someone with technical expertise in one or more security domains who executes the day-to-day security work. This may include things such as data analysis, firewall rule management, incident handling, and other operational activities.
* Manager or program manager: In security, a manager (or program manager) is someone who owns one or more processes related to information security. A security manager may be the owner for compliance, vulnerability management, or any other broad set of responsibilities that are executed by security analysts.
* Director: In security, a director is generally a manager of managers who is responsible for the overall strategic guidance of a group of security programs.

Some general user responsibilities include the following:
* Understand, agree to, and adhere to all information security policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines, as well as any relevant regulatory and compliance requirements. Users are also responsible for satisfying contractual obligations (such as nondisclosure agreements) that affect the confidentiality of the company’s information and processes.
* Complete all required information security training and awareness activities by their required completion dates.
* Report any actual or suspected security violations or breaches to appropriate personnel in a timely manner.

### Security Control Frameworks

A security control is a technical, operational, or management safeguard used to prevent, detect, minimize, or counteract security threats.

(ISC)2 defines a security control framework as “a notional construct outlining the organization’s approach to security, including a list of specific security processes, procedures, and solutions used by the organization.”

#### Control Objectives for Information Technologies (COBIT)

Control Objectives for Information Technologies (COBIT) is a framework developed by ISACA (previously known as the Information Systems Audit and Control Association) for overall information technology management and governance and is perhaps the most popular IT governance framework used in industry. While it is not a security-specific control framework, it does outline end-to-end IT governance objectives and processes that encompass many security requirements and concepts.

COBIT is based on six key principles for governance and management of enterprise IT:
* Provide Stakeholder Value
* Holistic Approach
* Dynamic Governance System
* Governance Distinct from Management
* Tailored to Enterprise Needs
* End-to-End Governance System

#### ISO/IEC 27001

ISO/IEC 27001 (sometimes referred to as just ISO 27001) is an information security standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). ISO 27001 is the most popular standard within the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards and is focused on the creation and maintenance of an information security management system (ISMS), which ISO defines as “a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure.”

ISO 27001:2013 contains 114 controls across 14 domains, as follows:
* Information security policies
* Organization of information security
* Human resource security
* Asset management
* Access control
* Cryptography
* Physical and environmental security
* Operations security
* Communications security
* System acquisition, development, and maintenance
* Supplier relationships
* Information security incident management
* Information security aspects of business continuity management
* Compliance

#### ISO/IEC 27002

ISO/IEC 27002 (again, often referred to as just ISO 27002) is titled “Security Techniques - Code of practice for information security controls.” This standard builds on ISO 27001 by providing guidelines for organizations to select, implement, and manage security controls based on their own security risk profile. In other words, ISO 27002 is a bit more prescriptive than ISO 27001, as it provides best-practice recommendations for organizations to build and maintain their ISMSs.


#### NIST 800-53

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is a nonregulatory agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, whose mission is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing standards and technologies. NIST publishes and manages a variety of special publications related to information security, cloud computing, and other technologies.

NIST 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,” is NIST’s massive security control framework. Though NIST 800-53 was initially created to aid U.S. government agencies in managing their security programs, it is widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive baselines of security controls and is referenced across many industries around the globe.

NIST 800-53 defines hundreds of security controls across the following 18 control families:
* Access control (AC)
* Awareness and training (AT)
* Audit and accountability (AU)
* Security assessment and authorization (CA)
* Configuration management (CM)
* Contingency planning (CP)
* Identification and authentication (IA)
* Incident response (IR)
* Maintenance (MA)
* Media protection (MP)
* Physical and environmental protection (PE)
* Planning (PL)
* Personnel security (PS)
* Risk assessment (RA)
* System and services acquisition (SA)
* System and communications protection (SC)
* System and information integrity (SI)
* Program management (PM)

#### NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), first published in 2014, is a collection of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. As of this writing, NIST CSF v1.1 is the current version and was released in 2018. NIST CSF was initially developed with a focus on industries considered “critical infrastructure” —industries such as banking, energy, and communications. It has since become a go-to controls framework for companies of all sizes and across all business sectors.

The five core functions within NIST CSF are intended to be performed simultaneously and continuously to form a culture of assessing and addressing cybersecurity risk.

NIST defines the purpose of each of the five core functions as follows:
* Identify (ID): Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.
* Protect (PR): Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.
* Detect (DE): Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
* Respond (RS): Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
* Recover (RC): Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

#### CIS Critical Security Controls

The CIS Critical Security Controls (or CIS Controls) is a publication of 20 best-practice guidelines for information security. The publication was initially created by SANS Institute but was transferred to the Center for Internet Security (CIS) in 2015. Today, you may see these 20 critical controls labeled CIS CSC, CIS 20, Sans Top 20, or other variants.

According to the Center for Internet Security, the 20 Critical Security Controls are as follows:
* CIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets
* CIS Control 2: Inventory and Control of Software Assets
* CIS Control 3: Continuous Vulnerability Management
* CIS Control 4: Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges
* CIS Control 5: Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations, and Servers
* CIS Control 6: Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs
* CIS Control 7: Email and Web Browser Protections
* CIS Control 8: Malware Defenses
* CIS Control 9: Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols, and Services
* CIS Control 10: Data Recovery Capabilities
* CIS Control 11: Secure Configuration for Network Devices, such as Firewalls, Routers, and Switches
* CIS Control 12: Boundary Defense
* CIS Control 13: Data Protection
* CIS Control 14: Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know
* CIS Control 15: Wireless Access Control
* CIS Control 16: Account Monitoring and Control
* CIS Control 17: Implement a Security Awareness and Training Program
* CIS Control 18: Application Software Security
* CIS Control 19: Incident Response and Management
* CIS Control 20: Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises

### Due Care and Due Diligence

#### Due Care

Due care is a legal term used to describe the conduct that a reasonable person would exercise in a given situation. In business, due care is using reasonable care to protect the interests of your organization. More specifically, in regard to information security, due care relates to the conduct that a reasonable person would exercise to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their organization’s assets.

Due diligence is another legal concept that relates to continually ensuring that behavior maintains due care. In other words, due diligence is the ongoing execution and monitoring of due care. In relation to information security, due diligence relates to the ongoing actions that an organization and its personnel conduct to ensure organizational assets are reasonably protected.

## DETERMINE COMPLIANCE AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS

### Legislative and Regulatory Requirements

#### U.S. Computer Security Act of 1987
Enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1987 with the objective of improving the security and privacy of sensitive information stored on U.S. federal government computers.

#### U.S. Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002

Enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2002 that greatly extends the Computer Security Act of 1987.  
FISMA acknowledges the importance of information security to the United States' economic and national security interests and requires that all U.S. federal government agencies and nongovernment organizations that provide information services to these agencies conduct risk-based security assessments that align with the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).

### Industry Standards and Other Compliance Requirements

#### U.S. Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)
Enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2002 to protect investors from fraudulent accounting activities by corporations.

#### System and Organization Controls (SOC, a.k.a. Service Organization Controls)
Released by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in 2011 to replace the SAS 70 audit standard.
The Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements document 18 (SSAE 18), titled Reporting on Controls, provides a common standard to be used by auditors performing assessments of service organizations with the intent of allowing the organization to conduct an external assessment instead of multiple third-party assessments and then sharing the resulting report with customers and potential customers.
Outside of the United States, similar engagements are conducted under the International Standard for Attestation Engagements (ISAE) 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization.

##### 3 Forms
* SOC 1: An audit and compliance report that focuses strictly on a company's financial statements and controls that can impact a customer's financial statements. A company that performs credit card processing is likely to require a SOC 1 audit and compliance report.
* SOC 2: An audit and compliance report that evaluates an organization based on AICPA's five "Trust Services principles": privacy, security, availability, processing integrity, and confidentiality. Many organizations undergo SOC 2 auditing and present a SOC 2 report to regulators and customers to demonstrate compliance with industry standard security controls.
  * Privacy
  * Security
  * Availability
  * Processing integrity
  * Confidentiality
* SOC 3: This is a "lite" version of a SOC 2 report and abstracts or removes all sensitive details. A SOC 3 report generally indicates whether an organization has demonstrated each of the five Trust Services principles without disclosing specifics (like exactly what they do or don't do). Companies make SOC 3 reports available to the public and restrict SOC 2 reports to trusted parties.

##### 2 Types of Reports
* Type I Reports These reports provide the auditor's opinion on the description provided by management and the suitability of the design of the controls. Type I reports also cover only a specific point in time, rather than an extended period. You can think of the Type I report as more of a documentation review where the auditor is checking things out on paper and making sure that the controls described by management are reasonable and appropriate.
* Type II Reports These reports go further and also provide the auditor's opinion on the operating effectiveness of the controls. That is, the auditor actually confirms that the controls are functioning properly. The Type II report also covers an extended period of time: at least six months of operation. You can think of the Type II report as more like a traditional audit. The auditors are not just checking the paperwork; they are also going in and verifying that the controls function properly.

#### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

The PCI DSS includes more than 200 security controls organized into 12 requirements, further categorized into 6 goals that generally align with security best practices. Per the PCI SSC, the PCI DSS covers the following:
* Build and Maintain a Secure Network
  * Requirement 1: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.
  * Requirement 2: Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.
* Protect Cardholder Data
  * Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data.
  * Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.
* Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program
  * Requirement 5: Use and regularly update antivirus software or programs.
  * Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.
* Implement Strong Access Control Measures
  * Requirement 7: Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know.
  * Requirement 8: Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.
  * Requirement 9: Restrict physical access to cardholder data.
* Regularly Monitor and Test Networks
  * Requirement 10: Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.
  * Requirement 11: Regularly test security systems and processes.
* Maintain an Information Security Policy
  * Requirement 12: Maintain a policy that addresses information security for employees and contractors.

## UNDERSTAND LEGAL AND REGULATORY ISSUES THAT PERTAIN TO INFORMATION SECURITY IN A HOLISTIC CONTEXT

### Cybercrimes and Data Breaches

A cybercrime is any criminal activity that directly involves computers or the internet. In a cybercrime, a computer may be the tool used to execute the criminal activity, or it may be the target of the criminal activity. There are three major categories of cybercrimes:
* **Crimes against people:** These crimes include cyberstalking, online harassment, identity theft, and credit card fraud.
* **Crimes against property:** Property in this case may include information stored within a computer, or the computer itself. These crimes include hacking, distribution of computer viruses, computer vandalism, intellectual property (IP) theft, and copyright infringement.
* **Crimes against government:** Any cybercrime committed against a government organization is considered an attack on that nation's sovereignty. This category of cybercrime may include hacking, theft of confidential information, or cyber terrorism. Hacktivism is another cybercrime that involves hackers seeking to make a political statement with their attacks. Hacktivists often target government entities but may also target other organizations with whom they disagree.

#### U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986

The major provisions of the original CCCA made it a crime to perform the following:
* Access classified information or financial information in a federal system without authorization or in excess of authorized privileges
* Access a computer used exclusively by the federal government without authorization
* Use a federal computer to perpetrate a fraud (unless the only object of the fraud was to gain use of the computer itself)
* Cause malicious damage to a federal computer system in excess of $1,000
* Modify medical records in a computer when doing so impairs or may impair the examination, diagnosis, treatment, or medical care of an individual
* Traffic in computer passwords if the trafficking affects interstate commerce or involves a federal computer system

When Congress passed the CFAA, it raised the threshold of damage from $1,000 to $5,000 but also dramatically altered the scope of the regulation. Instead of merely covering federal computers that processed sensitive information, the act was changed to cover all "federal interest" computers. This widened the coverage of the act to include the following:
* Any computer used exclusively by the U.S. government
* Any computer used exclusively by a financial institution
* Any computer used by the government or a financial institution when the offense impedes the ability of the government or institution to use that system
* Any combination of computers used to commit an offense when they are not all located in the same state

##### CFAA Amendments of 1994
* Outlawed the creation of any type of malicious code that might cause damage to a computer system
* Modified the CFAA to cover any computer used in interstate commerce rather than just "federal interest" computer systems
* Allowed for the imprisonment of offenders, regardless of whether they actually intended to cause damage
* Provided legal authority for the victims of computer crime to pursue civil action to gain injunctive relief and compensation for damages

##### Protected Computer in a 1996 amendment

In plain English, a protected computer is a computer used by the U.S. government or financial institutions, or one used for interstate and foreign communications and financial transactions.  
It's important to note here that this definition is broad enough to apply to any computer that is "used in or affecting" government and commerce - a computer does not need to be directly used or targeted by a cybercriminal to be considered protected under this definition.

The CFAA in a 1996 amendment establishes seven criminal offenses related to computer fraud and abuse and identifies the penalties for each:
* Obtaining national security information
* Accessing a computer and obtaining information
* Trespassing in a government computer
* Accessing to defraud and obtain value
* Damaging a computer or information
* Trafficking in passwords
* Threatening to damage a computer

#### U.S. Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986
Enacted by Congress in 1986 
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1986 to extend restrictions on government wire taps to include computer and network-based communications (rather than just telephone calls).  
The ECPA complements the CFAA by prohibiting eavesdropping, interception, and unauthorized monitoring of all electronic communications (including those sent over computer networks).

#### U.S. Economic Espionage Act of 1996
The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) was enacted by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in 1996. The EEA was the first federal law to broadly define and establish strict penalties for theft or unauthorized use of trade secrets. The EEA makes it a criminal offense to copy, download, upload, alter, steal, or transfer trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign entity. The EEA establishes penalties for economic espionage that include fines up to $10 million and imprisonment up to 15 years, as well as forfeiture of any property used to commit economic espionage or property obtained as a result of the criminal act.

This law has these two major provisions:
* Anyone found guilty of stealing trade secrets from a U.S. corporation with the intention of benefiting a foreign government or agent may be fined up to $500,000 and imprisoned for up to 15 years.
* Anyone found guilty of stealing trade secrets under other circumstances may be fined up to $250,000 and imprisoned for up to 10 years.

#### U.S. Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996
The Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) was issued in 1996 to restrict and punish the production and distribution of child pornography on the internet.

#### U.S. Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998

The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act was enacted in 1998, and formally established identity theft as a criminal act under U.S. federal law. Under the act, identity theft is "knowingly transfer[ring] or us[ing], without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of Federal law, or that constitutes a felony under any applicable State or local law."

#### USA PATRIOT Act of 2001

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act, commonly known as the Patriot Act, was signed into law in 2001 in response to the terrorist attacks that took place in the United States on September 11, 2001. The act was initially issued as a temporary measure, but most measures were reauthorized in 2006.  
The Patriot Act amends many of the provisions within the CFAA and the ECPA with both new definitions of criminal offenses and new penalties for previously and newly defined computer crimes.

* Section 202 — Authority to intercept wire, oral, and electronic communications relating to computer fraud and abuse offenses: This section amends the CFAA to authorize investigators to obtain a wiretap for felony violations relating to computer fraud and abuse.
* Section 209 — Seizure of voicemail messages pursuant to warrants: This section authorizes investigators to seize voicemail messages with a search warrant. Prior to the Patriot Act, voicemail was only authorized for seizure with a harder-to-obtain wiretap order.
* Section 210 — Scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications: This section updates previous law and grants access to additional information when filing a subpoena for electronic records.
* Section 212 — Emergency disclosure of electronic communications to protect life and limb: This section grants special provisions to allow a communications provider (like an ISP) to disclose customer information to law enforcement in emergency situations, such as imminent crime or terrorist attack. Prior to this amendment, communications providers may have been subject to civil liability suits for providing such information without the customer’s consent.
* Section 214 — Pen register and trap and trace authority under FISA: A pen register is a device that shows the outgoing calls made from a phone, while a trap and trace device shows incoming numbers that called a phone; these capabilities are often consolidated into a single device called a pen/trap device. This section of the Patriot Act authorizes use of these devices nationwide (as opposed to an issuing court’s jurisdiction) and broadens authority to include computer and internet-based communications.
* Section 217 — Interception of computer trespasser communications: This section amends previous law to allow communications providers and other organizations to allow law enforcement to intercept and monitor their systems. Prior to this amendment, companies were authorized to monitor their own systems, but were not permitted to allow law enforcement to assist in such monitoring.
* Section 220 — Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence: This section authorizes nationwide jurisdiction for search warrants related to electronic evidence, such as email.
* Section 808 — Definition of federal crime of terrorism: The official definition of terrorism includes, among other things, “destruction of communication lines, stations, or systems.”
* Section 814 — Deterrence and prevention of cyberterrorism: This section strengthens penalties associated with violations in the CFAA, including doubling the maximum prison sentence from 10 to 20 years.
* Section 815 — Additional defense to civil actions relating to preserving records in response to government requests: This amendment absolves an organization from civil penalties associated with violations of the ECPA if the organization is responding to “a request of a governmental entity.”
* Section 816 — Development and support for cybersecurity forensic capabilities: This section requires the U.S. Attorney General to establish regional computer forensic laboratories to support forensic examinations on seized or intercepted computer evidence. Section 816 also requires these laboratories to provide forensic analysis training and education to federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors. This section also includes open-ended language authorizing these forensic labs “to carry out such other activities as the U.S. Attorney General considers appropriate.”


#### U.S. Homeland Security Act of 2002

The Homeland Security Act was enacted in 2002, building off the Patriot Act’s response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. The Homeland Security Act sparked the largest U.S. government reorganization since the creation of the Department of Defense in 1947. Under the Homeland Security Act, dozens of government agencies, offices, and services were consolidated into the newly created U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). With the creation of the DHS, a new cabinet-level position, Secretary of Homeland Security, was also created. Title X of the Homeland Security Act identifies several standards, tactics, and controls that should be used to secure U.S. federal government information. Title X and its subsections establish the authorities, responsibilities, and functions associated with information security.


#### U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act of 2003

The U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicit Pornography and Marketing Act was signed into law in 2003. This law established the United States’ first national standards for sending commercial emails in response to the growing number of complaints over spam (unwanted) emails. The law requires companies to allow email recipients to unsubscribe or opt out from future emails and establishes a variety of requirements around email content and sending behavior. CAN-SPAM designates the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as responsible for enforcing the provisions within the Act.


#### U.S. Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004

The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and the position of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Under this law, the Department of Homeland Security and other U.S. government agencies are required to share intelligence information to help prevent terrorist acts against the United States. This act also established the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board with the intent of protecting the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. citizens.


#### The Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime of 2001

The Convention on Cybercrime, also known as the Budapest Convention, is the first international treaty established to address cybercrime. The treaty was first signed in 2001 and became effective in 2004, and has since been signed by more than 65 nations (the United States ratified the treaty in 2006). The treaty aims to increase cooperation among nations and establish more consistent national laws related to preventing and prosecuting cybercrime.


#### The Computer Misuse Act 1990 (U.K.)

The Computer Misuse Act came into effect in the United Kingdom in 1990 and introduced
five offenses related to cybercrime:
* Unauthorized access to computer material
* Unauthorized access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offenses
* Unauthorized acts with intent to impair, or with recklessness as to impairing, operation of computer, etc.
* Unauthorized acts causing, or creating risk of, serious damage
* Making, supplying, or obtaining articles for use in other offenses


#### Information Technology Act of 2000 (India)

The Information Technology Act was passed by the Indian Parliament in 2000 and amended in 2008. The act established legal recognition of electronic documents and digital signatures, while it also established definitions and penalties for cybercrimes such as data theft, identity theft, child pornography, and cyber terrorism.


#### Cybercrime Act 2001 (Australia)

The Cybercrime Act 2001 was Australia’s response to the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States. The Cybercrime Act 2001 defined serious computer offenses such as unauthorized access, unauthorized modification, and unauthorized impairment of electronic communication, and also established penalties for such crimes.


### Licensing and Intellectual Property Requirements

There are various organizations around the world that establish and protect IP rights; among them are the World Trade Organization (WTO), World Customs Organization (WCO), and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

There are numerous intellectual property laws and regulations in the United States, and they fit into five categories:
* Licensing
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Copyrights
* Trade secrets

### Licensing
Legal protections over intellectual property allow creators and inventors to profit from their work. Unfortunately, the ease with which information can be duplicated and transmitted has made it easier for people to copy information in violation of the legitimate owner’s rights.

### Patents
A patent is a government-issued license or grant of property rights to an inventor that prohibits another party from making, using, importing, or selling the invention for a set period of time. In the United States, patents are issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and are usually valid for 15 or 20 years.

There is a European Patent Office (EPO), Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO), and African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO), among others.

Patents have three main requirements:
* The invention must be new. Inventions are patentable only if they are original ideas.
* The invention must be useful. It must actually work and accomplish some sort of task.
* The invention must not be obvious. You could not, for example, obtain a patent for your idea to use a drinking cup to collect rainwater. This is an obvious solution. You might, however, be able to patent a specially designed cup that optimizes the amount of rainwater collected while minimizing evaporation.

### Trademarks
According to the USPTO, a trademark is "a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others."  
A service mark is a similar legal grant that identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods.  
The term trademark is commonly used to refer to both trademarks and service marks.

The acceptance of a trademark application in the United States depends on these two main requirements:
* The trademark must not be confusingly similar to another trademark—you should determine this during your attorney’s due diligence search. There will be an open opposition period during which other companies may dispute your trademark application.
* The trademark should not be descriptive of the goods and services that you will offer. For example, "Mike’s Software Company" would not be a good trademark candidate because it describes the product produced by the company. The USPTO may reject an application if it considers the trademark descriptive.

In the United States, trademarks are granted for an initial period of 10 years and can be renewed for unlimited successive 10-year periods.
Unlike patents, a trademark does not expire after a set period of time. Instead, trademark rights last as long as the mark is used in commerce, which can be as long as forever.


### Copyrights

A copyright is a legal protection granted to the authors of “original works of authorship” that may include books, movies, songs, poetry, artistic creations, and computer software, among other categories.

Current copyright law provides for a lengthy period of protection. Works by one or more authors are protected until 70 years after the death of the last surviving author. Works for hire and anonymous works are provided protection for 95 years from the date of first publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever is shorter.

Eight broad categories of works qualify for
copyright protection:
* Literary works
* Musical works
* Dramatic works
* Pantomimes and choreographic works
* Pictorial, graphical, and sculptural works
* Motion pictures and other audiovisual works
* Sound recordings
* Architectural works

#### Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)

In 1998, Congress recognized the rapidly changing digital landscape that was stretching the reach of existing copyright law.
To help meet this challenge, it enacted the hotly debated Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
The DMCA also serves to bring U.S. copyright law into compliance with terms of two World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties.

The first major provision of the DMCA is the prohibition of attempts to circumvent copyright protection mechanisms placed on a protected work by the copyright holder.
This clause was designed to protect copy-prevention mechanisms placed on digital media such as compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs (DVDs).
The DMCA provides for penalties of up to $1 million and 10 years in prison for repeat offenders.
Nonprofit institutions such as libraries and schools are exempted from this provision.

The DMCA also limits the liability of internet service providers (ISPs) when their circuits are used by criminals violating the copyright law.
The DMCA recognizes that ISPs have a legal status similar to the “common carrier” status of telephone companies and does not hold them liable for the “transitory activities” of their users.

To qualify for this exemption, the service provider’s activities must meet the following requirements (quoted directly from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, U.S. Copyright Office Summary, December 1998):

* The transmission must be initiated by a person other than the provider.
* The transmission, routing, provision of connections, or copying must be carried out by an automated technical process without selection of material by the service provider.
* The service provider must not determine the recipients of the material.
* Any intermediate copies must not ordinarily be accessible to anyone other than anticipated recipients and must not be retained for longer than reasonably necessary.
* The material must be transmitted with no modification to its content.

### Trade Secrets
A trade secret is a proprietary formula, process, practice, or combination of information that a company has exclusive rights to.


### Import/Export Controls

Many countries closely regulate the movement of technology through their borders. This might be done to protect local industries from external competition, limit the exportation of sensitive technologies (like encryption), or meet other policy goals of a particular nation.

One of the most well-known regulations that establishes import/export controls is the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). ITAR regulates the export of defense articles and defense services to keep those sensitive materials out of the hands of foreign nationals. ITAR applies to both government agencies and contractors or subcontractors who handle regulated materials outlined in the United States Munitions List (USML).

The European Union also places restrictions on dual-use technology. ECPA No. 428/2009 of May 5, 2009, requires member states to participate in the control of exports, transfer, brokering, and transit of dual-use items. In 2017, these regulations were updated to reflect controls over cyber weapons.


### Transborder Data Flow

The concept of transborder data flow is closely related to the previously discussed topic of import/export controls. More specifically, this concept focuses on requirements around restricting certain data to or from specific geographic locations or jurisdictions.

#### Russia
In 2015, Russia became one of the first regimes to require all data collected inside Russia on Russian citizens to be stored inside Russia.

#### China
In China, the enforcement of the Cybersecurity Law will place new restrictions on the movement of information. China has asserted sovereignty over the internet operating within its borders and has installed network protections, including limiting access points and strict firewall rules to censor data made available inside China.


### Privacy

#### U.S. Federal Privacy Act of 1974

The Federal Privacy Act is a U.S. law that was enacted in 1974. The Privacy Act establishes and governs practices related to the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of PII by U.S. government agencies. The purpose of the Privacy Act is to balance the government’s need to maintain information about citizens and permanent residents with the rights of those individuals to keep their personal information private.

#### Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994
The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994 amended the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986.
CALEA requires all communications carriers to make wiretaps possible for law enforcement with an appropriate court order, regardless of the technology in use.

#### U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996

HIPAA was signed into law in 1996, while the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule each went into effect in 2003. Organizations that must comply with HIPAA requirements are known as covered entities and fit into three categories:
* Health plans: This includes health insurance companies, government programs like Medicare, and military and veteran’s health programs that pay for healthcare.
* Healthcare providers: This includes hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, pharmacies, and other medical providers that transmit health information.
* Healthcare clearinghouses: This includes public and private organizations, like billing services, that process or facilitate the processing of nonstandard health information and convert it into standard data types. A healthcare clearinghouse is usually the intermediary between a healthcare provider and a health plan or payer of health services.

#### U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 is a U.S. federal law that establishes strict guidelines for online businesses to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13. COPPA applies to any organization around the world that handles the data of children residing in the United States and also applies to children that reside outside of the United States, if the company is U.S.-based. The law sets requirements for seeking parental consent and establishes restrictions on marketing to children under the age of 13.

#### Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is another specialized privacy bill that affects any educational institution that accepts any form of funding from the federal government (the vast majority of schools).
It grants certain privacy rights to students older than 18 and the parents of minor students.

Specific FERPA protections include the following:
* Parents/students have the right to inspect any educational records maintained by the institution on the student.
* Parents/students have the right to request correction of records they think are erroneous and the right to include a statement in the records contesting anything that is not corrected.
* Schools may not release personal information from student records without written consent, except under certain circumstances.

#### U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, is a U.S. law that requires financial institutions to safeguard their customer’s PII. Among the provisions within GLBA, the Financial Privacy Rule requires that financial institutions provide each customer with a written privacy notice that explains what personal information is collected from the customer, how it is used, and how it is protected. The GLBA Safeguards Rule requires organizations to implement proper security controls to protect their customers’ personal data.

#### U.S. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) of 2009

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, referred to as the HITECH Act, was enacted under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The HITECH Act was created to promote the expanded use of electronic health records (EHRs). Along with increased adoption, the act anticipated an increase in security and privacy risks. As such, the HITECH Act extended HIPAA privacy protections by improving security and privacy protections for healthcare data by imposing tougher penalties for HIPAA compliance violations. Under the HITECH Act, maximum financial penalties were raised to $1.5 million per violation category, per year.

The HITECH Act also introduced a new HIPAA Breach Notification Rule. Under this rule, covered entities are required to disclose a breach of unsecured protected health information to affected parties within 60 days of discovery of the breach. In addition to notifying affected individuals, the Breach Notification Rule requires covered entities to report breaches affecting 500 or more people to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and a major media outlet servicing the jurisdiction of the affected parties.

#### Data Protection Directive (EU)

The Data Protection Directive, officially known as Directive 95/46/EC, was enacted by the European Parliament in 1995. The Data Protection Directive aimed at regulating the processing of the personal data of European citizens. Although it has since been superseded by the GDPR (discussed in a later section), the Data Protection Directive was the first major privacy law in the European Union and is considered the foundational privacy regulation in all of Europe.

The DPD required that all processing of personal data meet one of the following criteria:
* Consent
* Contract
* Legal obligation
* Vital interest of the data subject
* Balance between the interests of the data holder and the interests of the data subject

The directive also outlined key rights of individuals about whom data is held and/or processed:
* Right to access the data
* Right to know the data’s source
* Right to correct inaccurate data
* Right to withhold consent to process data in some situations
* Right of legal action should these rights be violated


#### Data Protection Act 1998 (UK)

The Data Protection Act was established by the United Kingdom Parliament to enact the provisions within the EU’s Data Protection Directive. The Data Protection Act established that UK citizens held the legal right to control their personal information and was designed to enforce privacy of personal data stored on computing systems. The Data Protection Act 1998 was later superseded by the Data Protection Act 2018, which was designed to enforce and supplement provisions within the GDPR (discussed in a later section).

#### Safe Harbor

The International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, often short-handed as just “Safe Harbor,” is an agreement between the United States and European Union, established between 1998 and 2000, that was developed to reconcile differences between U.S. and EU privacy laws. Under Safe Harbor, a U.S. company could self-certify that it met data privacy requirements agreed upon by the United States and European Union. Safe Harbor was ruled invalid by the European Court of Justice in 2015 and replaced with the EU-US Privacy Shield soon after.

#### EU-US Privacy Shield

The EU-US Privacy Shield was the second attempt by the European Union and United States to agree upon principles to mutually regulate the exchange of personal data between the two jurisdictions. The agreement was reached in 2016, less than a year after Safe Harbor was ruled invalid by the European Court of Justice. By 2020, however, the same court declared the EU-US Privacy Shield invalid.

#### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU)

The GDPR is considered by most to be the world’s strongest data privacy law. GDPR was established in 2016 and replaced the EU’s 1995 Data Protection Directive with hundreds of pages of regulations that require organizations around the world to protect the privacy of EU citizens. With this sweeping regulation, companies around the world that do business with European customers have been forced to rethink their approach to data security and privacy.

GDPR Article 5 establishes and describes seven principles for processing personal data:
* **Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency:** Obtain and process personal data in accordance with applicable laws and fully inform the customer of how their data will be used.
* **Purpose limitation:** Identify “specific, explicit, and legitimate” purpose for data collection, and inform them of such purpose.
* **Data minimization:** Collect and process the minimum amount of data necessary to provide the agreed-upon services.
* **Accuracy:** Ensure that personal data remains “accurate and where necessary kept up-to-date.”
* **Storage limitation:** Personal data may be stored only long as necessary to provide the agreed-upon services.
* **Integrity and confidentiality:** Ensure appropriate security of personal data, and provide protection against unauthorized access, and accidental loss or destruction. This includes implementing data anonymization techniques to protect your customers’ identities, where necessary.
* **Accountability:** The data controller (i.e., the party that stores and processes the personal data) must be able to demonstrate compliance with all of these principles. Many customers pursue industry-standard certifications, like ISO 27001, to demonstrate accountability and commitment to security and privacy.

Article 17 within the GDPR establishes a person’s “right to be forgotten.” This provision grants the data subject (i.e., the person whose data is being used) the right to have their personal data deleted if one of several circumstances exists and is a critical concept that information security professionals must consider when developing their data storage and retention policies.

GDPR Chapter 4 contains several articles that establish requirements related to the data controller and processor and requires that data processors (i.e., an organization that stores and processes PII on behalf of a data controller) prioritize security and privacy. Of particular interest, Article 25 requires “data protection by design and by default”; this is a huge directive that codifies what security professionals have been recommending as best practice for years.

GDPR Article 33 establishes rules that require data controllers to notify proper authorities within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach.

##### GDPR Fines

The GDPR imposes stiff fines on data controllers and processors for noncompliance.

###### Determination

Fines are administered by individual member state supervisory authorities (83.1). The following 10 criteria are to be used to determine the amount of the fine on a noncompliant firm:
* **Nature of infringement:** Number of people affected, damage they suffered, duration of infringement, and purpose of processing
* **Intention:** Whether the infringement is intentional or negligent
* **Mitigation:** Actions taken to mitigate damage to data subjects
* **Preventative measures:** How much technical and organizational preparation the firm had previously implemented to prevent noncompliance
* **History:** Past relevant infringements, which may be interpreted to include infringements under the Data Protection Directive and not just the GDPR, and past administrative corrective actions under the GDPR, from warnings to bans on processing and fines
* **Cooperation:** How cooperative the firm has been with the supervisory authority to remedy the infringement
* **Data type:** What types of data the infringement impacts; see special categories of personal data
* **Notification:** Whether the infringement was proactively reported to the supervisory authority by the firm itself or a third party
* **Certification:** Whether the firm had qualified under-approved certifications or adhered to approved codes of conduct
* **Other:** Other aggravating or mitigating factors, including financial impact on the firm from the infringement

###### Lower Level

Up to €10 million, or 2 percent of the worldwide annual revenue of the prior financial year, whichever is higher, shall be issued for infringements of:
* Controllers and processors under Articles 8, 11, 25–39, 42, 43
* Certification body under Articles 42, 43
* Monitoring body under Article 41(4)

###### Upper Level

Up to €20 million, or 4 percent of the worldwide annual revenue of the prior financial year, whichever is higher, shall be issued for infringements of:
* The basic principles for processing, including conditions for consent, under Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9
* The data subjects’ rights under Articles 12–22
* The transfer of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organization under Articles 44–49
* Any obligations pursuant to member state law adopted under Chapter IX
* Any noncompliance with an order by a supervisory authority

## UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS FOR INVESTIGATION TYPES

**Burden of proof** is the requirement that the criminal prosecutor or civil plaintiff/claimant prove the claims they are making against the accused, or defendant. The party making a claim must demonstrate the truth of that claim, with compelling evidence; the entity defending against the claim, in most modern societies, is presumed innocent or without fault - that is, the court will not recognize the validity of a claim against anyone until that claim is substantiated and the defendant is proven guilty.

In the U.S. legal system, the two predominant standards of proof that must be met are called preponderance of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.
* **Preponderance of the evidence** is the lower standard of the two and is used primarily in civil actions. It essentially means that the evidence shows that the defendant is more likely to have caused the damage than not. In other words, the evidence convinced the judge, jury, or ruling body that there was at least a 51 percent chance that the defendant caused the damage.
* The second standard, **beyond a reasonable doubt**, is much harder to prove and is used primarily in criminal actions. It is insufficient for the evidence to merely make the judge or jury lean more toward guilt than not. In this case, the evidence has to be so clear and compelling that a “reasonable” person has no doubt or reservation about the defendant’s guilt after seeing it.

### Administrative

When discussing investigations, for (ISC)2 purposes, the term administrative will refer to actions constrained to those conducted within a single organization - that is, the organization performs an administrative investigation of itself. Internal investigations are typically performed when the matter involves some violation of organizational policy and does not involve any external entities such as law enforcement, investors, third-party suppliers, or attackers.

### Criminal

Criminal investigations involve prosecution under criminal laws. The government, at the federal, state, or local level, prosecutes violations of its laws by imposing fines, imprisonment, or, in some extreme cases, even death for offenders. Criminal investigations are conducted by law enforcement organizations, which can include local, state, federal, or even international agencies.

### Civil

Civil law governs relations and interactions between private entities. The plaintiff in a civil case sues for compensation for a loss or relief from some type of dispute. As information security practitioners, we may be called on to support our clients when they are either plaintiffs or defendants in civil suits. The following are examples of possible civil actions that a security professional, like you, may be involved in:
* **Your organization is the plaintiff:** If someone accesses your production environment without authorization and steals data, causing harm to your organization, your organization might sue the perpetrator for damages (restitution for the harm that was caused). You may be called on to oversee collection of evidence (e.g., logs from penetrated hosts, intrusion detection systems, and network appliances) proving the defendant caused the harm. (Note: This may be in addition to criminal action brought by the government against the defendant.)
* **Your organization is the defendant:** If a former employee accuses the organization of creating a hostile work environment, you may have to oversee collection of evidence (such as emails between managers and executives discussing how employees are treated), as well as preventing the destruction of potential evidence (referred to as destruction hold notice, preservation notice, litigation hold, or similar terms) upon request by courts or attorneys.

### Regulatory

Regulatory investigations involve determining whether an organization is compliant with a given regulation or legal requirement. Regulations have the force of law; consequently, regulatory investigations are similar to criminal investigations. Regulations are written under the auspices of protecting the average citizen or consumer, protecting the environment, or making an industry safer and more equitable.

### Industry Standards

ISO/IEC 27043:2015 recommends procedural steps for conducting security incident investigations.

ISO/IEC 27037:2012 provides guidelines for handling digital evidence.

NIST SP 800-86, “Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response,” overlaps significantly in terms of content with the two previous sources.

NIST SP 800-101 Revision 1, “Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics,” has a self-explanatory title.


## DEVELOP, DOCUMENT, AND IMPLEMENT SECURITY POLICY, STANDARDS, PROCEDURES, AND GUIDELINES

### Policies

A policy is a formal set of statements that establish a system of principles to guide decisions and actions. More specifically, a security policy is a set of statements that identifies the principles and rules that govern an organization’s protection of information systems and data. Policies can be company-wide, system-specific, or issue-specific (e.g., an incident response policy).

Some common examples of security policies include the following:
* Acceptable use policy
* Access control policy
* Change management policy
* Remote access policy
* Disaster recover policy


### Standards
Standards are specific and granular requirements that give direction to support broader, higher-level policies. Standards establish specific behavior and actions that must be followed and enforced to satisfy policies. Standards may be mandatory for a given organization, if mandated by contract or law.

Baselines are related to standards and establish a minimum level of a security for a system, network, or device.

As a subset of baselines, security baselines express the minimum set of security controls necessary to safeguard the CIA and other security properties for a particular configuration.

### Procedures

A procedure is a detailed step-by-step guide to achieve a particular goal or requirement. Procedures tell you how to implement your policies and how to meet your standards and baselines.

Some common examples of security procedures include the following:
* Vulnerability scanning procedures
* Backup and restore procedures
* Account provisioning procedures
* Patch management procedures

### Guidelines

A guideline is similar to a standard but is a recommendation rather than a mandatory requirement. Guidelines refer to policy statements and offer flexible suggestions for meeting the intent of the policy or recommendations to implement the requirements in standards and baselines.


### IDENTIFY, ANALYZE, AND PRIORITIZE BUSINESS CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS

* **A business continuity plan (BCP)** is a methodology and set of protocols that deals with allowing an organization to keep their key business functions running in the event of a crisis; this is sometimes referred to as continuity of operations (COOP). Business continuity includes all of the preventative controls and the management of employees that help preserve the functionality of the overall business during a disaster.
* **A disaster recovery plan (DRP)** is the set of processes that deal with restoring your information systems and operations, securely and efficiently, after a disruptive event occurs. DR is the subset of BC whose primary objective is to minimize business downtime and reclaim normal operations as soon as possible.

### Business Impact Analysis

According to the ISO, a business impact analysis is “the process of analyzing the impact over time of a disruption on the organization.” In other words, a BIA helps an organization identify its essential business functions and understand the impact that a disaster would have on each of those functions; the BIA provides the primary justification for the business continuity plan and its requirements. The BIA helps an organization identify which of its business functions are more resilient and which are more fragile.

To complete the BIA, you should begin by establishing your BC project team, scope, and budget; we cover this step in the next section, “Develop and Document the Scope and the Plan.” You should ensure that you have executive support for BCP activities.

The next step is one of the most important: identify all your critical business functions (CBFs) and other essential business elements. The key word here is business, as you should be focused on identifying the essential functions that are critical to your business operations, whether your business involves selling widgets or saving lives.

Identifying CBFs requires input from a broad range of stakeholders. The perspectives of the system owners, subject-matter experts, customers, and suppliers all help in identifying an organization’s potential CBFs.

A list of CBFs and essential business elements should include the following:
* Personnel
* Business processes
* Information systems and applications
* Other assets

Determining the level of impact of a disaster is done in several ways, and there are a few metrics that you should be comfortable with:
* **Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD)**, or maximum acceptable outage (MAO), expresses the total length of time a critical business function can be unavailable without causing significant, long-term harm to the business; it is the longest time a CBF can remain disabled before it threatens the organization’s long-term survival. MTD must be defined by the system owner, who is ultimately responsible to the organization for the proper operation of the CBF. Exceeding the MTD is an expression of unacceptable risk by the business owner.
* **Recovery time objective (RTO)** is the planned time necessary to restore a system to the point where it meets the minimum service expectations of the system owner. In other words, RTO is the maximum period of time within which a CBF must be restored after a disruption to avoid unacceptable business consequences. Since unacceptable disaster occurs when the MTD is exceeded, the RTO, by definition, must be less than or equal to the MTD. The RTO must be adjusted by the application of additional controls to bring it within the MTD. At the point where the business owner is no longer willing to apply control, they have accepted the risk of operation.
* **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** represents the measurement of tolerable data loss, represented as a period of time. As with the MTD, this must be defined by the business, and the business is responsible for resourcing the controls to achieve the RPO.



### Develop and Document the Scope and the Plan

#### Project Scope and Planning

* Perform a structured review of the business’s organization from a crisis planning point of view.
* Create a BCP team with the approval of senior management.
* Assess the resources available to participate in business continuity activities.
* Analyze the legal and regulatory landscape that governs an organization’s response to a catastrophic event.

While there is no one-size-fits-all for business continuity planning, the scope of most plans includes the following:
* Critical business functions
* Threats, vulnerabilities, and risks
* Data backup and recovery plan
* BCP personnel
* Communications plan
* BCP testing requirements

#### People

People are always, without exception, your most valuable and critical asset. The first goal of any BCP must be to ensure the safety of your people during and after an emergency. In the context of BCP, “people” include your employees, contractors, customers, vendors, and any other living human being that may be affected by an adverse event.

#### Processes

The BCP team must evaluate every critical business function and determine what resources must be available during a disaster. Your continuity plan should identify the critical supplies and logistics required to maintain critical operations, and it should establish a process to ensure those resources remain continuously available.

#### Technologies

Hardware and software failures —that’s just part of the reality of technology. A business continuity plan must anticipate these failures and outline controls and procedures to mitigate the risk of technology failure.

## CONTRIBUTE TO AND ENFORCE PERSONNEL SECURITY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES


### Candidate Screening and Hiring

Candidate screening and hiring the right employees is a critical part of assuring the security of your company’s systems and data. Not only do you need to make sure to hire the right fit for the job, but it’s also critical that you are familiar with a candidate’s background and history before bringing them into your organization and giving them access to your sensitive information.

There are a couple things your organization must do before beginning to recruit candidates for a position.
* First, the hiring manager should work with HR to clearly and concisely document the job description and responsibilities.
* Next, you should identify the classification or sensitivity of the role, based on the level of damage that could done by a person in that role who intentionally or negligently violates security protocols.

Once a potential employee or contractor is identified, your organization should verify the information in their application and confirm their suitability for the position by conducting a background check.

Generally speaking, an employment background check may include the following checks and verifications:
* Education
* Work history
* Citizenship
* Criminal record
* Credit and financial history
* References

### Employment Agreements and Policies

When joining an organization, an employee generally signs an employment contract that may include one or more employee agreements that make certain stipulations by which the employee must abide. The most common employee agreements are nondisclosure agreements and noncompete agreements.

#### Nondisclosure Agreement
A nondisclosure agreement (NDA) is an agreement that restricts an employee or contractor (or anyone else with access to sensitive information) from disclosing sensitive information they obtain through the course of their employment or relationship with an organization. An NDA is designed to protect the confidentiality of the organization’s data (such as trade secrets or customer information) and is often a lifetime agreement (even after the employee leaves the company).

#### Noncompete Agreement
A noncompete agreement is an agreement that restricts an employee from directly competing with the organization during their employment and, in most cases, for a fixed time after employment. Noncompetes are one-way agreements that are designed to protect organizations from unfair competition by former employees or contractors.


In addition to NDAs and noncompete agreements, employees may be responsible for reviewing and/or signing various employment policies such as **acceptable use policies**, **code of conduct**, or **conflict of interest policies**.

### Onboarding, Transfers, and Termination Processes

#### Onboarding

Setting good expectations for work behavior should start before the employee walks in the door. Part of the employee orientation program should address information security expectations and requirements. Employees should be reminded of their obligations to protect information and current threats to the organization’s information assets, particularly if they are likely to be the targets of malicious actors. Further, orientation practices should inform new employees of the processes for reporting security incidents, their role in maintaining the security of their work area, and the company’s classification and categorization processes so they can identify the level of control necessary for particular information.

#### Transfers

Organizations should have well-defined policies and procedures for handling an employee transferring from one role to another. Part of this process should involve reviewing the employee’s existing access to information and evaluating the need for continued access to the same information. Where possible, your organization should seek to remove access that will no longer be needed in the employee’s new role; this enforces the principle least privilege, which we discussed earlier in this chapter. In addition, you should have a process in place to identify any role-based training that the employee needs to take prior to the transfer; this is particularly critical when the employee’s new role comes with new responsibilities or access to information at a higher sensitivity.

#### Termination

Taking appropriate care when people depart an organization is just as important as ensuring they are properly brought into the organization. Terminations may be voluntary (i.e., an employee retires or finds a new job) or involuntary (i.e., an employee is fired, furloughed, or otherwise “let go”). These former insiders represent a risk to the organization, and appropriate actions must be taken to ensure they do not compromise the operations, intellectual property, or sensitive information with which they have been entrusted.

When an individual leaves an organization on good terms, it is relatively easy to go through the standard checklist: suspending electronic access, recovering their access badges and equipment, accounting for their keys, and changing the key codes on cipher locks that the departing employee used are among many other standard practices. Most organizations have well-structured off-boarding processes to ensure the removal of access when an individual is no longer entitled to organizational information or resources.

Involuntary termination of employment is an emotionally charged event for all involved. In virtually all cases, an involuntary termination forces the employer to assume the terminated individual is a threat to the organization, and appropriate action should be taken to protect organizational assets. Termination procedures at most organizations include specific processes to notify the information security organization to disable access to electronic and physical systems.

Where possible, recovery of property that an involuntarily terminated employee used should be attempted. Where appropriate, the recovered material should be tracked as evidence and retained for subsequent forensic analysis. Finally, once the individual has left the organization, remaining staff should be informed that the terminated individual is no longer allowed access and that any attempts by that individual to access resources or property should be reported.

### Vendor, Consultant, and Contractor Agreements and Controls

Many organizations require expertise or talent that does not exist inside their organizations. These relationships may exist for goods or services, but both types of acquisition open the organization to risk. Information security policies should be in place to ensure that these relationships do not expose the organization’s sensitive information to an unreasonable amount of risk. NDAs and other employment agreement policies play a big part in establishing expectations with third parties and can lead to additional compliance burden on the organization who must enforce them.

### Compliance Policy Requirements

Responsibilities for compliance with applicable policies and regulations should be clearly documented and understood by all employees within an organization. In many cases, employees may be required to sign an attestation stating that they have reviewed and agree to comply with all company policies and applicable regulations.

Employees and other parties with access to systems and information must undergo initial and periodic training that includes security awareness and job-based training. Generally, annual recertification is a good way to ensure that all parties with access remain in compliance with employment policies.

### Privacy Policy Requirements

Your organization’s privacy policy is an explanation of your company’s personal data collection and use practices. Privacy policies should link back to applicable privacy laws and regulations, such as HIPAA in the United States and GDPR (discussed later in this chapter) for companies that handle EU residents’ information.

Your privacy policy should explain what kind of personal data is collected, how your organization will or won’t use it, and how the personal data will be stored, maintained, and secured. The privacy policy should be made available to all personnel, and many organizations require a signed acknowledgment from each employee.

## UNDERSTAND AND APPLY RISK MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS

### Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities

In security, a **risk** is the potential for negative impact on the organization, its goals or objectives, or its assets (including people, systems, and data) due to a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

##### Inherent Risk
Inherent risk is the level of natural, native, or default risk that exists in an environment, system, or product prior to any risk management efforts being performed. Inherent risk can exist due to the supply chain, developer operations, design and architecture of a system, or the knowledge and skill base of an organization. Inherent risk is also known as initial risk or starting risk. This is the risk that is identified by the risk assessment process.

##### Residual Risk
Once safeguards, security controls, and countermeasures are implemented, the risk that remains is known as residual risk. Residual risk consists of threats to specific assets against which upper management chooses not to implement a response. In other words, residual risk is the risk that management has chosen to accept rather than mitigate. In most cases, the presence of residual risk indicates that the cost/benefit analysis showed that the available safeguards were not cost-effective deterrents.

##### Total Risk
Total risk is the amount of risk an organization would face if no safeguards were implemented.

##### Controls Gap
The controls gap is the amount of risk that is reduced by implementing safeguards.

> threats * vulnerabilities * asset value = total risk

> total risk – controls gap = residual risk

#### Threats

A threat is a negative event that can lead to an undesired outcome, such as damage to, or loss of, an asset. A threat is posed by a **threat actor**, which is a person or entity that is capable of intentionally or accidentally compromising an asset’s security. As security professionals, threats are the people and events that we work to protect our information and systems from.

Examples of security threats include the following:
* A hacker who wants to encrypt your data and charge you a ransom for it
* A disgruntled employee who wants to steal or sell corporate information
* A fire or other natural disaster that may damage or destroy your datacenter

#### Vulnerabilities

A vulnerability is a weakness or gap that exists within a system that may be exploited (by a threat actor) to compromise an asset’s security or trigger a risk event. Vulnerabilities are the things within our systems that we try to fortify and improve.

Examples of security vulnerabilities include the following:
* Unpatched software applications
* Weak access control mechanisms (e.g., weak passwords)
* Faulty fire suppression systems

#### Assets

An asset is anything of value, which may include people, property, and information. Assets are the things that we, as security professionals, are trying to protect. People assets may include your company’s employees, contractors, and vendors, as well as your customers. Property assets include tangible things like servers and equipment, as well as intangible things like software code and other intellectual property.

### Risk Assessment

Remember that risks are the intersection between threats, vulnerabilities, and assets, as shown in Figure 1.5.

A risk assessment is the set of activities that involve identifying the threats and vulnerabilities that exist and determining the impact and likelihood of those threats exploiting the identified vulnerabilities.

#### Risk Identification

The first step in a typical risk assessment process is to identify your assets and determine the value of those assets; this includes identifying and classifying your sensitive data, based on its sensitivity or value to your organization. During the risk identification phase, you find the systems, applications, and information that need protecting and then identify and describe the vulnerabilities and threats that pose a risk to each of those assets.

#### Risk Analysis

Risk analysis should always begin with a vulnerability assessment and a threat analysis. This stage of risk assessment is focused on evaluating the likelihood of identified threats exploiting weaknesses (i.e., vulnerabilities) in your environment and determining the impact to your assets if that happens. Likelihood describes the probability that an event will occur, and impact defines how disastrous the event would be if it were to happen.

Likelihood can be identified by evaluating each threat and assessing the probability that the threats might actually exploit a vulnerability, or weakness.

Impact can be identified by establishing the value associated with each potentially affected asset and determining how that value will be destroyed or otherwise affected by an adverse event.

An asset’s value can be both **quantitative** (i.e., determined by its cost or market value) or **qualitative** (i.e., determined by its relative importance to you or your organization). By establishing an asset’s value, you can better determine the impact of that asset’s security being compromised - this allows informed decision-making when determining how much to spend on safeguarding a given resource, as you never want to spend more protecting an asset than the asset itself is worth.

#### Quantitative Risk Calculation

One important concept in quantitative risk analysis is annualized loss expectancy (ALE), which is a metric that helps quantify the impact of a realized threat on your organization’s assets.

ALE is measured in dollars and is the product of **single loss expectancy (SLE)** and **annual rate of occurrence (ARO)**, which are each discussed here:
* **SLE** is a measure of the monetary loss (calculated in dollars) you would expect from a single adverse event. In other words, SLE estimates how much you would lose from one occurrence of a particular realized threat. SLE is calculated by multiplying an **asset’s value (AV)** by its **exposure factor (EF)**. EF is the estimated percentage of loss to a specific asset if a specific threat is realized.
* **ARO** is the estimated annual frequency of occurrence for a given adverse event. In other words, ARO is the number of times that you expect a particular risk event to occur every year.

* Here are the two formulas to keep in mind:
> ALE = SLE * ARO

> SLE = AV * EF

#### Risk Evaluation

During risk evaluation, you compare the results of your risk analysis to your organization’s established risk profile or risk tolerance (i.e., how much risk your organization is willing to take on). In doing so, you are able to determine the best course of action for each of your identified risks. We cover the various options for risk response in the following section.

### Risk Response/Treatment

Once you identify and assess your organization’s threats, vulnerabilities, and risks, you must determine the best way to address each risk; this is known as risk treatment (or risk response).

#### Avoid
Risk avoidance involves eliminating an identified risk by stopping or removing the activity or technology that causes the risk in the first place. Organizations use risk avoidance when a particular risk exceeds their acceptable risk tolerance, but complete avoidance is often difficult to achieve without business disruption. While this type of risk treatment can often mean simply not doing something, policies that ban the use of removable media or personal cloud storage services are avoidance steps that require upfront investment and action.

#### Mitigate

Risk mitigation (sometimes called risk reduction or risk modification) is a strategy that involves reducing the likelihood of a threat being realized or lessening the impact that the realized threat would have on the organization. Risk mitigation is the most common treatment option for identified risks and involves implementing policies and technologies to reduce the harm that a risk might cause. Moving from single-factor to mutifactor authentication is an example of a mitigation treatment for sensitive data access.

#### Transfer

Risk transference (also known as risk assignment) involves shifting the responsibility and potential loss associated with a risk onto a third party. Insurance is the most common form of risk transference.
For example, if a company loses customer data due to a cyber breach, the company may rely on their cyber insurance to cover any monetary losses associated with the breach.
In this case, the breached organization has transferred financial risk to their cyber insurer, but the company still must manage through some level of reputational risk.
It’s hard to completely transfer all risk, so many people instead use the term **risk sharing**. Using cloud-based services or managed security services is a great example, because risk is split between you, as the customer, and the third-party provider.

#### Accept

Risk acceptance unsurprisingly involves accepting the risk associated with a particular threat.
Risk acceptance is the way to go if avoiding, mitigating, or transferring the risk would cost more than the expected losses of the realized threat.
In theory, a risk should be accepted only if it is completely within an organization’s risk tolerance.
In practice, organizations are often forced to accept potentially painful risks associated with normal business operations.

### Countermeasure Selection and Implementation

Countermeasures generally fall into three categories:
* **Personnel-related:**
As people are commonly considered to be an organization’s “weakest link,” these countermeasures often prove invaluable. Hiring (or firing), organization restructuring, and awareness training are some common personnel-related countermeasures.
Despite our potential as weaknesses, people in high-performing organizations with strong security awareness programs can often prove to be the greatest security asset.
* **Process-related:**
Policy, procedure, and other “workflow-based” mitigations generally fall into this category. As an example, consider the implementation of separation of duties on invoice approval and payment as a process-related mitigation against cyber fraud.
* **Technology-related:**
This is the category that typically gets the most attention. Encryption, modifying configuration settings, and other hardware or software changes are common examples of technology-related countermeasures.

#### Security-Effectiveness

Measuring the security-effectiveness of a security control is an essential step in the selection and implementation process.
When selecting your countermeasures, you want to be certain that the specific policy, technology, or operational control that you select is able to directly address a risk identified during your risk analysis process.
To do this, one must consider what kind of security risks one wants to prevent, detect, or correct, and then identify countermeasures that specifically target those risks.
For example, many security teams choose to throw encryption at everything, but if you are concerned with risks that encryption cannot fix (like availability risks), you are better off using those resources for other countermeasures (such as backups).


#### Cost-Effectiveness

Perhaps even more important than security-effectiveness (believe it or not), cost-effectiveness is a primary consideration for security teams and the management teams that oversee them.
Cost-effectiveness can be calculated by performing a cost-benefit analysis that compares the cost of a countermeasure (or multiple countermeasures) to the costs that would be realized by a compromise of the risks that the countermeasures are intended to mitigate.


#### Operational Impact

Beyond cost-effectiveness and pure security-effectiveness, you must be sure to evaluate the potential operational impact that a countermeasure may have on your organization.
If a countermeasure is too difficult to implement or use, it may have a counterintuitive effect and actually increase risk because it is not being used properly (or at all).

#### Applicable Types of Controls

A **security control** is any safeguard that is put in place to positively impact security.
Security controls may be automatic or manual, and they can be technical (i.e., implemented and executed through hardware, software, or firmware),
operational (i.e., related to day-to-day operations and tangible things like security guards, gates, etc.),
or management (i.e., implemented by people and related to administrative methods —things like policies, procedures, and guidelines).

There are five major types of controls, and you’ll notice that some countermeasures (like security guards) may fit into multiple categories:

* **Preventative:**
These are the first-line controls that are designed to keep adverse security events from occurring.
For example, software applications typically have some form of “input validation” to avoid invalid inputs from being executed and causing an issue.
Firewalls, system backups, and security awareness training are other common examples of preventative controls.

* **Detective:**
These controls are designed to identify a negative security event while it is in progress or soon after it occurs.
Much like a human detective, this type of control is intended to gather information and help security teams determine what happened, how bad the damage is, and what caused it to happen.
Security audits, door alarms, and IDSs are common examples of detective controls.

* **Corrective:**
These controls are designed to minimize and repair damages following an adverse security event; they are typically put in place after a detective control identifies a problem.
Corrective controls include things such as software patches, configuration file modifications, and new policies that target the cause of the incident.

* **Recovery:**
These countermeasures are designed to complement corrective controls, with the intent to get a system back to normal as quickly as possible.
Examples include system and data backups and disaster recovery sites.

* **Deterrent:**
These controls are designed to discourage attackers by making them think twice about their malicious intents.
Wired fences, security guards, and guard dogs are some examples of deterrents.

## Control Assessments

Periodic assessment of your security controls is equally as important as the selection and implementation of those controls.
In many cases, your organization may have legal or regulatory requirements that dictate how and when to **conduct security control assessments (SCA)**, but in all cases, you should routinely conduct control assessments to ensure that your security and privacy controls remain effective.

NIST 800-53A, “Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations,” lays out some helpful guidelines for conducting controls assessments and describes the three assessment methods as follows:

* Examine:
This method is “the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more assessment objects (i.e., specifications, mechanisms, or activities).
The purpose of the examine method is to facilitate assessor understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence.”
Assessors often begin an SCA by requesting a list of artifacts or evidence (such as security policies, configuration files, etc.) that they can examine to form an initial perspective.

* Interview:
This method is “the process of holding discussions with individuals or groups of individuals within an organization to once again, facilitate assessor understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence.”
After reviewing any evidence provided during the examine phase, assessors meet with key stakeholders to gain additional clarity on what security controls are in place and how they work.

* Test:
This method is “the process of exercising one or more assessment objects (i.e., activities or mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior.”
In this stage, an auditor or assessor is seeking to confirm that security controls are implemented as they are documented and that they are operating effectively and as intended.

### Monitoring and Measurement

Monitoring and measurement of your controls is an important part of operating a risk-based security program.
In addition to conducting periodic (e.g., annual or quarterly) security and privacy control assessments, you should actively and intentionally monitor your controls to measure their effectiveness and assess the health of your overall security program.
Depending on your organization’s needs, you should develop a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that allow you to quantify and measure the long-term performance of your controls.

### Reporting

Conducting SCAs and other monitoring and measurement activities is useless without a well-managed reporting function.
Auditors and assessors generally create formal reports that detail their findings for each control that is assessed.
In addition, your security team should have a process to document and report any important discoveries or metrics to senior leadership, regulators, and other stakeholders.

In general, a well-managed risk-based security program includes some level of reporting for the following:
* Internal audits (e.g., self-assessments)
* External audits (i.e., regulator or any other third-party audits)
* Significant changes to the organization’s risk posture
* Significant changes to security or privacy controls
* Suspected or confirmed security breaches (or other incidents)

### Continuous Improvement

A common goal among security leaders is to continuously improve their organization’s security posture and measure their journey toward their desired end state.

Risk maturity modeling is a process that allows an organization to assess the strength of its security program and create a plan for continuous improvement based on their results.
By identifying the maturity of its program on a predefined scale, an organization may better focus on what types of behaviors are necessary to improve, rather than getting caught up strictly in individual security gaps.

### Risk Frameworks

A **risk framework** is a structured process for identifying, assessing, and managing an organization’s risks.

From a governance perspective, the selection of a framework should create a controls environment that is as follows:
* **Consistent:**
A governance program must be consistent in how information security and privacy are approached and applied.

* **Measurable:**
The governance program must provide a way to determine progress and set goals. Most control frameworks contain an assessment standard or procedure to determine compliance and, in some cases, risk as well.

* **Standardized:**
As with measurable, a controls framework should rely on standardization so results from one organization or part of an organization can be compared in a meaningful way to results from another organization.

* **Comprehensive:**
The selected framework should cover the minimum legal and regulatory requirements of an organization and be extensible to accommodate additional organization-specific requirements.

* **Modular:**
A modular framework is more likely to withstand the changes of an organization, as only the controls or requirements needing modification are reviewed and updated.

#### International Standards Organization

##### ISO 31000 Series

The International Standards Organization has developed the ISO 31000 series of standards to identify principles for general risk management and to provide a set of guidelines for implementation.
Developed using the consistent language contained in ISO/IEC Guide 73:2009, the ISO 31000:2018 is intended to be applicable to any organization, regardless of the governance structure or industry.
The standard encourages the integration of risk management activities across organizational lines and levels to provide the organization with a consistent approach to management of operational and strategic risks.

ISO 31000:2018 is based on a set of eight principles that drive the development of the risk framework shown in Figure 1.7. That framework, in turn, structures the processes for implementing risk management.

The eight ISO 31000 principles are described here:
* **Customized:**
The framework should be customized and proportionate to the organization and the level of risk.

* **Inclusive:**
The appropriate and timely involvement of stakeholders is necessary.

* **Comprehensive:**
A structured and comprehensive approach is required.

* **Integrated:**
Risk management is an integral part of all organizational activities.

* **Dynamic:**
Risk management anticipates, detects, acknowledges, and responds to changes in a timely fashion.

* **Best available information:**
Risk management explicitly considers any limitations of available information.

* **Human and cultural factors:**
Human and cultural factors influence all aspects of risk management.

* **Continual improvement:**
Risk management is continually improved through learning and experience.

To assist organizations in implementing the ISO 31000 standard, ISO 31004, “Risk Management - Guidance for the implementation of ISO 31000,” was published to provide a structured approach to transition their existing risk management practices to be consistent with ISO 31000 and consistent with the individual characteristics and demands of the organization.

##### ISO 27000 Series

While the 31000 series addresses general risk, information security practices are addressed in the ISO 27000 series.
The use of the ISO/IEC Guide 73 allows for a common language, but ISO/IEC 27005:2011, “Information technology—Security techniques - Information security risk management,” gives detail and structure to the information security risks by defining the context for information security risk decision-making.
This context includes definition of the organization’s risk tolerance, compliance expectations, and the preferred approaches for assessment and treatment of risk.

#### U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology

Through a hierarchy of publications, the National Institute of Standards and Technology provides direction to U.S. government agencies in implementing information security practices.
In the current incarnation, the Risk Management Framework (RMF) provides a structured analytical process to identify, control, evaluate, and improve the organization’s information security controls.
Documented in NIST Special Publication 800-37, “Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems,” it prescribes a six-step process through which the federal government manages the risks of its information systems; the six steps are pictured in Figure 1.8.
Though the steps in this framework are tailored to government agencies, they are widely applicable within just about every industry.

##### Categorize System

The first step of the NIST RMF involves categorizing all information systems based on the potential impact to the organization due to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
Implied in this process is that the organization must have a comprehensive inventory of systems to apply the categorization standard.

##### Select Controls

Once security categorization has been performed, a baseline set of controls must be selected based on the identified categorization and impact.

##### Implement Controls / Assess Controls

Once the system has been categorized and baseline controls are selected, the controls must be implemented and monitored to ensure that they “are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.”
This will produce a set of documents certifying the technical application of the controls.

##### Authorize System

After categorizing information systems, selecting and implementing controls, and assessing the effectiveness of those controls, organizational leadership then makes a formal decision whether to authorize the use of the system.
This decision is based on the ability of the controls to operate the system within the organization’s risk tolerance.

##### Monitor Controls

Finally, the organization must continuously monitor the effectiveness of the controls over time to ensure that the ongoing operation of the system occurs within the organization’s risk tolerance.

#### COBIT and RiskIT

In the late 1990s, the audit community in the United States and Canada recognized that there was a significant gap between IT governance and the larger organizational management structures.
Consequently, IT activities were often misaligned with corporate goals, and risks were not comprehensively addressed by the control structure or consistently reflected in financial reporting.
To address this gap, ISACA developed a framework through which the IT activities of an organization could be assessed.

The Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology framework differentiates processes into either Governance of Enterprise IT (five processes) or Management of Enterprise IT (32 processes).
Each process has a set of objectives, inputs, key activities, and outputs, and measures to evaluate performance against the objectives.
As the framework is closely aligned with other management frameworks and tools (ISO 20000, ISO 27001, ITIL, Prince 2, SOX, and TOGAF), it has gained wide acceptance as an encompassing framework for managing the delivery of IT.

Based on the ISACA COBIT governance framework, the RiskIT framework provides a structure for the identification, evaluation, and monitoring of information technology risk.
This simplifies the integration of IT risk into the larger organization enterprise risk management (ERM) activities.

The RiskIT framework consists of three domains - risk governance, risk evaluation, and risk response - each of which has three processes.
The framework then details the key activities within each process and identifies organizational responsibilities, information flows between processes, and process performance management activities.
Additional detail on how to implement the framework and link it to other organizational management practices is contained in the RiskIT Practitioner Guide.


## UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THREAT MODELING CONCEPTS AND METHODOLOGIES

**Threat modeling** is a technique by which you can identify potential threats to your systems and applications, as well as identify suitable countermeasures against those threats.

The **attack surface** is the total range of areas where an attacker can potentially execute a compromise.
With an information system, this might include the methods of communication, the access controls, or weaknesses in the underlying architectures.
With a physical environment, the attack surface might include the construction techniques, the location, or the means of entrance and egress.
Limiting the attack surface to the minimum number of areas of exposure reduces the opportunities for a threat to become a successful attack.

It has two goals in mind with this process:

* To reduce the number of security-related design and coding defects
* To reduce the severity of any remaining defects

### Threat Modeling Concepts

#### Attacker-centric

The attacker-centric threat modeling approach starts by identifying the various actors who could potentially cause harm to a system.
With an attacker-centric approach, you start by profiling a potential attacker’s characteristics, skillset, and motivation, and then use that profile to identify attackers who would be most likely to execute specific types of attacks.
This approach can be helpful when narrowly approaching a problem by limiting the number of scenarios under analysis.

Tactical military intelligence is typically driven by an attacker-centric threat model, as are many business continuity/disaster recovery planning processes.
If you work in financial services, you may be familiar with attacker-centric modelling from anti-money laundering (AML) and other anti-financial crimes applications.
AML processes involve using process models of how money launderers operate when they attack to identify steps to take in order to thwart such attacks.

#### Asset-centric

As opposed to an attacker-centric approach, an asset-centric threat model identifies the assets of value first.
Assets should be characterized by their value to the organization as well as their value to potential attackers.
The means by which the asset is managed, manipulated, used, and stored are then evaluated to identify how an attacker might compromise the asset.

Many compliance regimes focus on protection of an asset (e.g., PHI under HIPAA, PII under the GDPR, or cardholder data under PCI-DSS), so this approach is helpful when establishing or verifying compliance.
You’ll also find this approach particularly useful when protecting other high-value assets such as intellectual property and security credentials.

#### Software-centric (or System-centric)

For many information systems environments, the software-or system-centric model is most useful.
In this approach, the system is represented as a set of interconnected processes, using architecture diagrams such as dataflow diagrams (DFDs) or component diagrams.
These diagrams are then evaluated by threat analysts to identify potential attacks against each component and to determine whether a security control is necessary, exists, and achieves the control effect.

### Threat Modeling Methodologies

#### STRIDE

STRIDE is a threat modeling methodology developed by Microsoft in the late 1990s to help identify and classify computer security threats.

The name itself is a mnemonic for six categories of security threats, discussed here:
* **Spoofing:**
Spoofing is an attack during which a malicious party assumes the identity of another party (either a user or a system) by falsifying information.
A common example of identity spoofing occurs when email spammers modify the “From:” field to depict the name of a sender that the target recipient is more likely to trust.
Within applications, spoofing can occur if an attacker steals and uses a victim’s authentication information (like username and password) to impersonate them within the application.

* **Tampering:**
Data tampering is an attack on the integrity of data by intentionally and maliciously manipulating data.
Tampering can include altering data on disk, in memory, over the network, or elsewhere.
Applications that don’t properly validate user input may allow malicious actors to modify values and have the manipulated data stored and used by the application.

* **Repudiation:**
Repudiation is the ability of a party to deny that they are responsible for performing an action.
The threat of repudiation occurs when a user claims that they did not perform an action, and no other party is able to prove otherwise.
In the physical world, signing for a mail delivery is a common form of nonrepudiation - the delivery company maintains a record that you received and accepted the mail on a specific date.
In the digital world, an example of a repudiation threat is a user claiming that they did not make an online purchase - even if they did, in fact, make that purchase.
Comprehensive logging, digital signatures, and multifactor authentication can be integrated into applications to provide nonrepudiation for high-risk actions.

* **Information disclosure:**
Information disclosure is when information is shared with an unauthorized party - such as during a data breach or when inadvertently sending an email to the wrong person.
This threat compromises the confidentiality of data and carries a great deal of risk depending on the sensitivity of the leaked data.
Organizations that store and process PII, PHI, cardholder data, or other confidential information should focus on this threat, and identify controls to mitigate against it.
Data encryption, strong access control, and other data protection mechanisms are the keys to protecting against unauthorized information disclosure.

* **Denial of service:**
A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a common availability attack that denies access to resources by legitimate users.
Controls should be put in place to monitor and detect abnormally high resource consumption by any single user; this may be an indication of either malicious or unintentional resource exhaustion.
As a principle, applications should be developed with availability and reliability in mind.

* **Elevation of privilege:**
Elevation of privilege (or privilege escalation) occurs when an unprivileged user is able to upgrade their privileges to those of a privileged user (e.g., a system administrator).
Elevation of privilege can give an untrusted party the “keys to the kingdom” and grant them access to and control over sensitive data and systems.
Strong access control is required to help protect against this threat. Systems should revalidate a user’s identity and credentials prior to granting privileged access, and multifactor authentication should be used, wherever possible.

#### PASTA
The Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) is a risk-based threat model, developed in 2012, that supports dynamic threat analysis.
The PASTA methodology integrates business objectives with technical requirements, making the output more easily understood by upper management.

There are seven stages of the PASTA methodology:
* Define objectives
* Define technical scope
* Application decomposition
* Threat analysis
* Vulnerability analysis
* Attack enumeration
* Risk and impact analysis

#### NIST 800-154
NIST 800-154, “Guide to Data-Centric System Threat Modeling,” was released in draft form in 2016.
It explicitly rejects that best-practice approaches are sufficient to protect sensitive information, as best practice is too general and often overlooks controls specifically tailored to meet the protection of the sensitive asset.

NIST 800-154 establishes four major steps for data-centric system threat modeling:
1. Identify and characterize the system and data of interest.
2. Identify and select the attack vectors to be included in the model.
3. Characterize the security controls for mitigating the attack vectors.
4. Analyze the threat model.

#### DREAD
DREAD is an older threat modeling technique, previously used by Microsoft but later abandoned.

DREAD provides a mnemonic for quantitative risk rating security threats using five categories:
* Damage
* Reproducibility
* Exploitability
* Affected users
* Discoverability

Though it is sparsely used today, you should be familiar with the DREAD mnemonic and the categories that it represents.

#### Other Models
Other threat modeling methodologies include the following:
* Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) is an approach for managing information security risks, developed at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI).
* Trike is an open-source threat modeling approach and tool that focuses on using threat models as a risk management tool.
* Construct a platform for Risk Analysis of Security Critical Systems (CORAS), also open source, is a European project that relies heavily on Unified Modeling Language (UML) as the front end for visualizing the threats.
* Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat Modeling (VAST) is a proprietary approach that leverages Agile concepts.

### Threat Modeling Steps

#### Identifying Threats

#### Determining and Diagramming Potential Attacks

#### Performing Reduction Analysis

In the decomposition process, you must identify five key concepts:
* Trust Boundaries Any location where the level of trust or security changes
* Dataflow Paths The movement of data between locations
* Input Points Locations where external input is received
* Privileged Operations Any activity that requires greater privileges than of a standard user account or process, typically required to make system changes or alter security
* Details about Security Stance and Approach The declaration of the security policy, security foundations, and security assumptions

#### Prioritization and Response

##### Probability × Damage Potential

The ranking technique of Probability × Damage Potential produces a risk severity number on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 the most severe risk possible.
Each of the two initial values can be assigned numbers between 1 and 10, with 1 being lowest and 10 the highest.

##### High/Medium/Low Rating

The high/medium/low (1/2/3 or green/yellow/red) rating process is even simpler. It creates a basic risk matrix or heat map (Figure 1.5).
As with any means of risk assessment, the purpose is to help establish criticality prioritization.
Using a risk matrix, each threat can be assigned a probability and a damage level. Then when these two values are compared, the result is a combined value somewhere in the nine squares.
Those threats in the HH (high probability/high damage) area are of the highest priority and concern, whereas those in the LL (low probability/low damage) area are of least priority and concern.

## APPLY SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS

### Risks Associated with Hardware, Software, and Services

Any time an organization considers using third-party hardware, software, or services, the organization must determine how the new hardware, software, or services may fit into the organization’s existing environment, and evaluate how the additions may impact the organization’s overall security posture.

#### Malicious Code in the Supply Chain

The widespread use of proprietary commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software requires customers to trust the security practices of the vendors.
However, many instances have been documented where that trust has been abused, and the COTS vendors become a vehicle to introduce vulnerabilities or compromise the CIA aspects of the customers’ data.

### Third-Party Assessment and Monitoring

To minimize supply chain risk, appropriate controls must be applied to verify the security practices of all involved parties.
In most cases, controls have been identified that would address security risks; the toughest challenge is to ensure that third parties actually do what they should to protect your organization’s information from those risks.

Any organization that does business with contractors, vendors, or any other third parties should have a third-party risk management policy that establishes a third-party risk management program responsible for assessing, monitoring, and controlling risks associated with outsourcing to third parties.
Governance and oversight activities should include onsite security surveys, formal security audits of third-party systems, and penetration testing, where feasible.
Any new third party should be assessed against your organization’s security requirements, and gaps should be documented and closely monitored.
Further, vendors and other third parties should be regularly reassessed and continuously monitored to ensure that they continue to adequately protect your organization’s information.

### Minimum Security Requirements

Similar to baselines and standards (discussed earlier in this chapter), your organization should establish minimum security requirements (MSRs) that define the least acceptable security standards that vendors and other parties in your supply chain must satisfy.
Of course, you should strive to ensure that your third parties have the strongest possible security postures, but MSRs, as the name suggests, describe the lowest level of security that your organization is willing to accept from a third party.
To avoid issues, your MSRs should take into consideration any legal, contractual, or regulatory requirements that you are required to satisfy; you should not establish an MSR that is below any external security compliance requirement.
You must also be prepared to audit and assess third parties’ compliance with any MSRs that you have established and communicated.

### Service-Level Requirements

A **service-level agreement (SLA)** is a contractual agreement between a service provider and its customers that establishes the minimum performance standards that the provider is obligated to meet.
When dealing with vendors and other third parties, SLAs serve as documented and agreed-upon performance requirements that a customer can use to hold the third party accountable.

### Frameworks

Several frameworks explicitly address supply chain risks. This is an evolving area of risk management, but the complexities of managing the information systems supply chain have been evident for many years.

#### NIST IR 7622

The U.S. government began directly addressing cyber supply chain risk as a separate issue with the publication of NIST IR 7622, “Notional Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems.”
This work recognizes that the actions required of the entities in the supply chain will change depending on their role, as will the level and type of control to be applied.

The document identifies 10 practices that should be taken into account in addressing supply chain risk:

* Uniquely identify supply chain elements, processes, and actors.
* Limit access and exposure within the supply chain.
* Establish and maintain the provenance of elements, processes, tools, and data.
* Share information within strict limits.
* Perform supply chain risk management awareness and training.
* Use defensive design for systems, elements, and processes.
* Perform continuous integrator review.
* Strengthen delivery mechanisms.
* Assure sustainment activities and processes.
* Manage disposal and final disposition activities throughout the system or element lifecycle.

The U.S. government has a number of other supply chain risk management initiatives,
including the **Committee on National Security Systems Directive 505, “Supply Chain Risk Management,”** which specifically addresses security requirements for strategic national systems
and the **Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Number 11**, which provides a set of tools to agencies to manage their cybersecurity supply chain through a risk-driven approach.

#### ISO 28000

ISO 28000:2007, “Specification for security management systems for the supply chain,” provides a broad framework for managing supply chain risk.
While not specific to cybersecurity, ISO 28000 is useful for organizations that leverage other ISO specifications (such as ISO 9001 and ISO 27001) to align supply chain risk with the organizations’ audit processes or that seek to use a standardized, risk-based approach to evaluating supply chain risk.

ISO 28000:2007 relies heavily on the continuous process improvement model of plan, do, check, act (PDCA) to improve the security management system and to assure organizational conformance to the security practice.
This approach facilitates the integration of supply chain risk with broader organizational risk management activities.

#### U.K. National Cyber Security Centre

The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) proposed guidance that attempts to provide organizations with improved awareness of supply chain risks, while also establishing 12 principles intended to help organizations establish and maintain effective control of their supply chain.

The 12 supply chain principles are divided into these separate stages:
1. **Understand the risks:**
The principles in this stage involve identifying your vendors in your supply chain and establishing what needs to be protected in that supply chain (and why).

2. **Establish control:**
This stage involves establishing minimum security requirements (see the earlier section “Minimum Security Requirements”) and communicating your security expectations to your suppliers.

3. **Check your arrangements:**
This stage involves establishing assurance activities and building those into your supply chain processes. This includes establishing audit rights, key performance indicators, and other testing/validation activities.

4. **Continuous improvement:**
This stage involves continually building trust with your suppliers and constantly encouraging security improvements for your supply chain.


## ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A SECURITY AWARENESS, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING PROGRAM

### Methods and Techniques to Present Awareness and Training

A standard security awareness program should include, at a minimum:
* new user orientation
* lectures or computer-based trainings (CBTs)
* printed materials like posters and handouts that share security tips

In addition:
* phishing and other social engineering exercises
* security champions
* gamification

to help raise awareness of important security topics.

### Periodic Content Reviews

Information security is a constantly evolving field, with security threats and vulnerabilities that are forever changing.
As such, it’s important that you regularly review the content within your security awareness, education, and training program to certify that it remains relevant.
Content should be reviewed and updated annually, at a minimum, to ensure that there is no reference to obsolete or irrelevant technologies or terminology, and these reviews should validate that all security awareness and training materials reflect current security trends, concepts, and concerns that are relevant to your organization and industry.

### Program Effectiveness Evaluation

There are several methods by which you can evaluate the effectiveness of your security awareness program. Some examples include the following:

* **Training metrics:**
Simple metrics like training completion rates are a great place to start when evaluating the effectiveness of your security awareness program. These types of metrics can tell you whether your training resources are reaching a sufficient percentage of your employees and may alert you if alternate delivery methods are necessary.

* **Quizzes:**
This is one of the most effective methods of measuring program effectiveness through knowledge retention. Quizzes are most reliable when measuring the effectiveness of security policies and related information. Analysis of quiz results should be conducted to identify trends that reveal necessary modifications to your training materials; if a substantial number of your employees get the same question wrong, it likely means you need to provide further (or clearer) information about that topic.

* **Security awareness days or weeks:**
By sponsoring security awareness days or weeks, you not only have an opportunity to provide security education, but you can also use this as an opportunity to solicit feedback from your employees on the program itself. You can provide attendees with anonymous questionnaires that allow them to express their opinion about the current program and propose new ideas on content delivery.

* **Inherent evaluation:**
As previously stated, you can also measure the effectiveness of your awareness program by evaluating your organization's overall security posture. Certain metrics, such as the number of phishing emails and other security issues reported to IT, can provide a great deal of insight into the effectiveness of your program. As your company's employees are increasingly educated on security risks, you should start to see the number of self-reported security issues rise. It's better to see a rise in reported suspected issues than a rise in successful compromises.
