# Risk Framework

The RMF, defined by NIST in SP 800-37 Rev. 2 (csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/final), establishes mandatory security requirements for federal agencies. This is the primary risk framework referenced by the CISSP exam.

The RMF has six cyclical phases (see Figure 2.5):

**Prepare** to execute the RMF from an organization- and system-level perspective by establishing a context and priorities for managing security and privacy risk.

**Categorize** the system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system based on an analysis of the impact of loss.

**Select** an initial set of controls for the system and tailor the controls as needed to reduce risk to an acceptable level based on an assessment of risk.

**Implement** the controls and describe how the controls are employed within the system and its environment of operation.

**Assess** the controls to determine if the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcomes with respect to satisfying the security and privacy requirements.

**Authorize** the system or common controls based on a determination that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the nation is acceptable.

**Monitor** the system and the associated controls on an ongoing basis to include assessing control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system and environment of operation, conducting risk assessments and impact analyses, and reporting the security and privacy posture of the system.
