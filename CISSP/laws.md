# Laws

## Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)


The major provisions of the original
CCCA made it a crime to perform the following:
- Access classified information or financial information in a federal system without authorization or in excess of authorized privileges
- Access a computer used exclusively by the federal government without authorization
- Use a federal computer to perpetrate a fraud (unless the only object of the fraud was to gain use of the computer itself)
- Cause malicious damage to a federal computer system in excess of $1,000
- Modify medical records in a computer when doing so impairs or may impair the examination, diagnosis, treatment, or medical care of an individual
- Traffic in computer passwords if the trafficking affects interstate commerce or involves a federal computer system


Collectively, these changes are referred to as the Computer Abuse Amendments Act of 1994 and included the following provisions:
- Outlawed the creation of any type of malicious code that might cause damage to a computer system
- Modified the CFAA to cover any computer used in interstate commerce rather than just “federal interest” computer systems
- Allowed for the imprisonment of offenders, regardless of whether they actually intended to cause damage
- Provided legal authority for the victims of computer crime to pursue civil action to gain injunctive relief and compensation for damages


## Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), responsible for developing the FISMA implementation guidelines, outlines the following elements of an effective information security program:
- Periodic assessments of risk, including the magnitude of harm that could result from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the organization
- Policies and procedures that are based on risk assessments, cost-effectively reducing information security risks to an acceptable level and ensuring that information security is addressed throughout the lifecycle of each organizational information system
- Subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for networks, facilities, information systems, or groups of information systems, as appropriate
- Security awareness training to inform personnel (including contractors and other users of information systems that support the operations and assets of the organization) of the information security risks associated with their activities and their responsibilities in complying with organizational policies and procedures designed to reduce these risks
- Periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, practices, and security controls to be performed with a frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually
- A process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to address any deficiencies in the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the organization
- Procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents
- Plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations for information systems that support the operations and assets of the organization


## Copyright and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act

Copyright law guarantees the creators of “original works of authorship” protection against the unauthorized duplication of their work. Eight broad categories of works qualify for copyright protection:
- Literary works
- Musical works
- Dramatic works
- Pantomimes and choreographic works
- Pictorial, graphical, and sculptural works
- Motion pictures and other audiovisual works
- Sound recordings

## Encryption Export Controls

The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) sets forth regulations on the export of encryption products outside the United States.


## U.S. Privacy Law

### Fourth Amendment

The basis for privacy rights is in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It reads as follows:
> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

### Privacy Act of 1974

The Privacy Act mandates that agencies maintain only the records that are necessary for conducting their business and that they destroy those records when they are no longer needed for a legitimate function of government. It provides a formal procedure for individuals to gain access to records the government maintains about them and to request that incorrect records be amended.


### Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986

The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) makes it a crime to invade the electronic privacy of an individual.


### Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994

The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994 amended the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. CALEA requires all communications carriers to make wiretaps possible for law enforcement with an appropriate court order, regardless of the technology in use.


### Economic Espionage Act of 1996

The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 extends the definition of property to include proprietary economic information so that the theft of this information can be considered industrial or corporate espionage. This changed the legal definition of theft so that it was no longer restricted by physical constraints.


### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which made numerous changes to the laws governing health insurance and health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Among the provisions of HIPAA are privacy and security regulations requiring strict security measures for hospitals, physicians, insurance companies, and other organizations that process or store private medical information about individuals.


### Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009

In 2009, Congress amended HIPAA by passing the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. This law updated many of HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements and was implemented through the HIPAA Omnibus Rule in 2013.


### Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998

In April 2000, provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) became the law of the land in the United States. COPPA makes a series of demands on websites that cater to children or knowingly collect information from children.
- Websites must have a privacy notice that clearly states the types of information they collect and what it’s used for, including whether any information is disclosed to third parties. The privacy notice must also include contact information for the operators of the site.
- Parents must be provided with the opportunity to review any information collected from their children and permanently delete it from the site’s records.
- Parents must give verifiable consent to the collection of information about children younger than the age of 13 prior to any such collection. Exceptions in the law allow websites to collect minimal information solely for the purpose of obtaining such parental consent.


### Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999

Until the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) became law in 1999, there were strict governmental barriers between financial institutions. Banks, insurance companies, and credit providers were severely limited in the services they could provide and the information they could share with each other. GLBA somewhat relaxed the regulations concerning the services each organization could provide.


### USA PATRIOT Act of 2001

Congress passed the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001 in direct response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, DC. The PATRIOT Act greatly broadened the powers of law enforcement organizations and intelligence agencies across a number of areas, including when monitoring electronic communications.


### Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is another specialized privacy bill that affects any educational institution that accepts any form of funding from the federal government (the vast majority of schools). It grants certain privacy rights to students older than 18 and the parents of minor students. Specific FERPA protections include the following:
- Parents/students have the right to inspect any educational records maintained by the institution on the student.
- Parents/students have the right to request correction of records they think are erroneous and the right to include a statement in the records contesting anything that is not corrected.
- Schools may not release personal information from student records without written consent, except under certain circumstances.


### Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act

In 1998, the president signed the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act into law. In the past, the only legal victims of identity theft were the creditors who were defrauded. This act makes identity theft a crime against the person whose identity was stolen and provides severe criminal penalties (up to a 15-year prison term and/or a $250,000 fine) for anyone found guilty of violating this law.


## European Union Privacy Law

### European Union Data Protection Directive (DPD)

On October 24, 1995, the European Parliament passed a sweeping Data Protection Directive (DPD) outlining privacy measures that must be in place for protecting personal data processed by information systems. The directive went into effect three years later in October 1998, serving as the first broad-based privacy law in the world. The DPD required that all processing of personal data meet one of the following criteria:
- Consent
- Contract
- Legal obligation
- Vital interest of the data subject
- Balance between the interests of the data holder and the interests of the data subject The directive also outlined key rights of individuals about whom data is held and/or processed:
- Right to access the data
- Right to know the data’s source
- Right to correct inaccurate data
- Right to withhold consent to process data in some situations
- Right of legal action should these rights be violated


### European Union General Data Protection Regulation

The European Union passed a new, comprehensive law covering the protection of personal information in 2016. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in 2018 and replaced the DPD on that date. The main purpose of this law is to provide a single, harmonized law that covers data throughout the European Union, bolstering the personal privacy protections originally provided by the DPD.


The key provisions of the GDPR include the following:

- **Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency** says that you must have a legal basis for processing personal information, you must not process data in a manner that is misleading or detrimental to data subjects, and you must be open and honest about data processing activities.
- **Purpose limitation** says that you must clearly document and disclose the purposes for which you collect data and limit your activity to disclosed purposes.
- **Data minimization** says that you must ensure that the data you process is adequate for your stated purpose and limited to what you actually need for that purpose.
- **Accuracy** says that the data you collect, create, or maintain is correct and not misleading, that you maintain updated records, and that you correct or erase inaccurate data.
- **Storage limitation** says that you keep data only for as long as it is needed to fulfill a legitimate, disclosed purpose and that you comply with the “right to be forgotten” that allows people to require companies to delete their information if it is no longer needed
- **Security** says that you must have appropriate integrity and confidentiality controls in place to protect data.
- **Accountability** says that you must take responsibility for actions you take with protected data and that you must be able to demonstrate your compliance.


## Canadian Privacy Law

### Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)


Canadian law affects the processing of personal information related to Canadian residents. Chief among these, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) is a national-level law that restricts how commercial businesses may collect, use, and disclose personal information.


Generally speaking, PIPEDA covers information about an individual that is identifiable to that individual. The Canadian government provides the following examples of information covered by PIPEDA:
- Race, national, or ethnic origin
- Religion
- Age
- Marital status
- Medical, education, or employment history
- Financial information
- DNA
- Identifying numbers
- Employee performance records

The law excludes information that does not fit the definition of personal information, including the following examples provided by the Information Commissioner of Canada:
- Information that is not about an individual, because the connection with a person is too weak or far-removed
- Information about an organization such as a business
- Information that has been rendered anonymous, as long as it is not possible to link that data back to an identifiable person
- Certain information about public servants such as their name, position, and title
- A person’s business contact information that an organization collects, uses, or discloses for the sole purpose of communicating with that person in relation to their employment, business, or profession


## State Privacy Laws

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is an excellent example of this principle in action. California passed this sweeping privacy law in 2018, modeling it after the European Union’s GDPR. Provisions of the law went into effect in 2020, providing consumers with the following:
- The right to know what information businesses are collecting about them and how the organization uses and shares that information
- The right to be forgotten, allowing consumers to request that the organization delete their personal information, in some circumstances
- The right to opt out of the sale of their personal information
- The right to exercise their privacy rights without fear of discrimination or retaliation for their use
