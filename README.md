## OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC

The [OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti) supports automated information sharing for cybersecurity situational awareness, real-time network defense, and sophisticated threat analysis.

### STIX - A structured language for cyber threat intelligence

Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).

STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine readable manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.

STIX is designed to improve many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.

### TAXII - A transport mechanism for sharing cyber threat intelligence

Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII™) is an application layer protocol for the communication of cyber threat information in a simple and scalable manner.

TAXII is a protocol used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI) over HTTPS. TAXII enables organizations to share CTI by defining an API that aligns with common sharing models.

TAXII is specifically designed to support the exchange of CTI represented in STIX.
